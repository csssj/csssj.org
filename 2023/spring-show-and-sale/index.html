        <h2>What Else Do I Need To Know?</h2>

        <p>A few things to make your visit as much fun as possible:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep up to date with the announcements on our <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/SJcactussucculents/">Facebook</a>
            and <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/sj_cactus_succulent/">Instagram</a>
            pages.
          </li>

          <li>
            No early birds, please. The doors open at 10:00 on
            Saturday, and not before.
          </li>

          <li>
            Saturday morning tends to be <i>extremely</i> busy! If
            you’d like a quieter time to visit, we’d recommend
            Saturday after 2 pm, or Sunday.
          </li>

          <li>
            Pets, in particular dogs, are not allowed. (Sorry. It’s
            not that we don’t love them. It’s just that it’s safer for
            everyone if they stay home, and in any case, school rules forbid
            it.)
          </li>

          <li>
            To make shopping safer and more pleasant, the aisles will be
            wider than in pre-pandemic days.
          </li>

          <li>
            Even though the aisles are wider than in years past, and
            you’re welcome to bring your cart to help transport all of
            your purchases, please keep your cart out of the aisles
            themselves. You’re welcome to park your transport in the
            Cart Corral, adjacent to the Plant Hotel, until you’re
            ready to check out.
          </li>

          <li>
            You may want to take advantage of our Plant Hotel to
            hold your plants while you continue shopping. Be sure to
            hang on to your claim check, so you can retrieve your
            plants. (Please note that plants must be must be picked up
            90 minutes before the end of each day’s sale. Also, those
            who’ve attended previous Show and Sale events should note
            that the Plant Hotel has moved, and is now outside the
            building, in the courtyard.) For more details on the Plant
            Hotel, see the <a
            href="/public-docs/PlantHotelFAQ.html">Plant Hotel
            FAQ</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can sign up for CSSSJ membership at the Show and Sale.
            Please note, however, that we will not be taking
            membership signups at the door during early access.
          </li>

          <li>
            Ask questions! Many of our members are highly-regarded
            experts, and are more than happy to talk about cactus and
            succulent plants.
          </li>

          <li>
            You may pay for your purchase using cash or a credit card.
            Our systems support Apple Pay and Google
            Pay. Unfortunately, we will not be able to take checks.
          </li>

        <h2>How Can I Help?</h2>

        <p>
          Thanks for asking! There are several things you can do
          before and during the event.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Volunteer!</b> If you're a member, please consider
            volunteering. You get to interact with customers, as well
            as fellow club members, in a fun environment. Have a look
            at the <a
            href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/4090d4eadae2ea1fc1-csssj#/">signup</a>
            page to see what slots are still open.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Tell your friends.</b> Point them at our website and this
            page, as well as at the club’s <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/SJcactussucculents/">Facebook</a>
            and <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/sj_cactus_succulent/">Instagram</a>
            pages.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Bring your own boxes or reusable containers.</b> While
            we amass a large set of boxes for your use before each
            sale, their numbers tend to dwindle as the day progresses.
            Scrap paper — old newspaper, or packing paper — is also
            immesely useful for padding purchases securely.
          </li>
        </ul>
