Process #2:  RESERVING SPACE FOR THE CLUB’S HOLIDAY LUNCHEON

<tr><td align="right"><font size="-1"> Revision #1.0,  dated 11/1/09</br>

</TABLE>
<P>
PURPOSE:  The purpose of this process is to document the steps necessary for reserving space for the club’s Holiday Luncheon.
</P>
<P>
WHEN HELD:  The Holiday Luncheon is usually held the first or second Sunday in December.  Preference is for the first Sunday, since many people start having schedule conflicts later in the month.
</P>
<P>
TIME HELD:  The room is reserved from 10:30AM til 3:30PM, with a published meeting start time for attendees of 11AM.  Many attendees do not arrive until 11:30 or 12.  
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY LUNCHEON NOTICE PUBLICATION:  The date, time, and location of the annual Holiday Luncheon is published in the Cactus Courier newsletter, and also on the club’s website, <a href="http://www.csssj.org">http://www.csssj.org</a>.
</P>
<P>
LOCATION:  Harry’s Hofbrau Restaurant, Saratoga Ave near Kiely Blvd, in San Jose, California.  We use the big Banquet Room at the rear of the restaurant.  Individuals purchase their own choice of meal on their way in, and take it to the tables in the Banquet Room.
</P>
<P>
HOW TO RESERVE THE ROOM:  The meeting room must be scheduled nearly a year ahead of time -- in January or February for the following December -- in order to have a reasonable chance of securing our desired date.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Harry’s Hofbrau is a chain of restaurants, headquartered in Redwood City.  They have now centralized their room reservation service to be handled from their headquarters Central Booking Department.  Our contact there is a woman named Loren, 650-366-3765.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All arrangements with Loren to date have been handled by phone.   Loren does NOT provide an Rental Application form to be filled out, nor does she send a written confirmation of the location/date/time/price.  It is advisable that WE take the initiative to send her a “thank-you” letter, in which we provide written confirmation of our verbal agreement regarding the location/date/time/price.  	 Also include a copy of the desired table layout (see diagram next page).<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The room rental charge is $300, payable in advance.  (We used to guarantee a certain number of meals instead, but that proved to be too hard to track.) 
</P>
<P>
PROGRESS CHECK:   Our contact at the specific restaurant location that we use is a woman named Lisa, 408-243-0434.  It is a good idea to drop by to see Lisa in late November, to make sure all is on track, and that she has a copy of the table layout diagram (see next page), so that we do not have to rearrange the tables ourselves.
</P>
<P>
ACCESS & HOUSEKEEPING:  On the Luncheon date, one of the Restaurant employees unlocks the room before we arrive.  The Restaurant sets up 8 double-length tables with white table cloths and 4 chairs on each side of each double-length table for our attendees to sit at.  They also provide 12 extra tables for us to put plants on, using the floorplan we provided.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People bringing in plants may arrive as early as 10:30AM to get set up, and may come in through the back door directly from the parking lot.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Restaurant provides all housekeeping afterwards, but any dirt/leaves from plants should be removed by ourselves.
