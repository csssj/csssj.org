This month, we will be exchanging stories about how and why we became involved with succulent plants.
</P>
<P>
Bring your favorite plant, a plant that has taxed your patience, or a plant about which you have a question.
</P>
<P>
  This is a chance to enthrall your fellow enthusiasts with the details of how you raised that magnificent ribbon winner from a tiny seed or seedling, to commiserate over an ailing favorite, or to get the advice needed to bring a plant around or even turn it into a show stopper.

fmart ("My love affair with Martian flowers","Joseph Hidalgo","<TABLE width='100%'><tr><td><img src='stapeliagigantea.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=15 align='left'>You love to love them.  You love to kill them.  Pamper them to death by overwatering or turn your back and lose them to mealy bugs, they are our pride and joy, stars in our collections.  I am talking about the succulent plants in the subfamily <I>Asclepiadoideae</I>.  Whether they are the very cactus looking <I>Hoodia</I> or the orchids of the succulent world, <I>Stapelia</I>, or the curious forms of alien looking Madagascan <I>Ceropegia</I>, xerophytic plant collectors always have one or more plants that have caught their eye over the passage of time.</P><P>I got bit by this bug many years ago, when I was lazily sorting through page after page of eBay listings for succulents and cactus in the wee hours of the morning.  What caught my eye was the flower of <I>Stapelia gigantea</I>.  The thing looked unreal.  It looked fake, like a flesh colored, giant, one foot starfish glued to succulent stems.</P><P>Anyway, being on the computer, I googled images of the plant and sure enough the bloom was real.  So after a short checkout process and the passage of a business week, my plant arrived from Florida, where the grower grew them in ground under her lemon tree.  (I also heard this from a man in San Diego.)  I opened the box to see the flower wilted, but at least there was physical proof as I tried in vain to open the shriveled bloom, trying to recreate the glory.</P><P>After repotting, the buds that were forming at the base of another stem wilted.  Nevertheless, I was semi-content watching the stems multiply over the summer and then stop growing once fall arrived.  I kept it underneath a protective overhang during the winter, and it survived frost in addition to a little rain from our winter-spring rainy season with no damage.  As soon as the heat came with spring, it resumed growth.  During the hottest part of the year, the eight stems had lengthened and multiplied to fill the pot nicely and had some nice big buds on them.  I was disappointed in thinking that a foot big bloom cannot possibly come from ‘that’, which looked to me like a slightly hairy closed lime green tulip.</P><P>A few days passed, and the closed bloom grew.  Not wanting to miss the show, I dusted and cleaned the spider webs off the terra cotta pot and put it on my kitchen table near a sunny window.  I awoke the next morning and was awestruck by what this amazing plant had produced, an 11.5 in., flesh colored, hairy, stinky flower!  A very unique aura was emanating from it, a halo of  damp towels that have been sitting too long, boys locker room, and lightly rotting trash, but &quot;who cares&quot; I thought, it was really a flower to see!  And of course, it had to do this when there was no club meeting, so no mini show points could be awarded.  My roommate admired it as well, but we decided to keep it outside as the unique perfume was permeating our small front room.  I took it outside and put it in its old area.  Almost immediately, one fly landed on it.  A bit recoiled I watched in amazement as more flies gathered on it and lapped at the bloom as if it were hot dog doo. When I checked on the plant a few hours later, there were fly eggs stuck to the middle of the flower, I guessed where the smell was the strongest.  Gross but smart, as these plants ingeniously use flies as pollinators in an arid environment where butterflies, moths and birds would be scarce.</P><P>From that point on, I tried to get my hands on every succulent plant in this family with varying degrees of horticultural success.  The plants are extremely prone to mealy bugs, and they need a regular systemic insecticide to thrive.  Not all growing requirements are the same, so do the research.</td></tr><tr><td><img src='huerniazebrina.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=15 align='right'><br><I>Hoyas</I> grow in subtropical to tropical humid conditions with lower light levels that some orchids favor as <I>Hoodias</I> coming from Namibia can stand some of our winter rains and full sun.  Some <I>Ceropegias</I> climb other plants in full sun, others ramble in the shade of shrubs.  If you are going to start off with a species, I do recommend <I>Stapelia gigantea</I> as it is easier to care for.  Another great starter is <I>Huernia zebrina</I>, also known as the life saver plant, named so because a major part of the bloom looks like a cherry lifesaver. Both of these beginner plants are South African and need well drained soil, and a winter rest with the smallest amount of water.  Standard watering habits that apply for most succulents in the summer, apply with these two species as well, watering only when the soil is dry.  Just be prepared to make more room in your abode, because once you are bit, the only cure is more plants!</td></tr></TABLE>");

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","<TABLE><tr><td valign='top'><img src='maihueniopsis platyacanthus seedlings.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=13 align='left' vspace=0><br>Usually I do not send out photos of seedlings except to certain people that are into growing from seed also.  The cotyledon leaves are the first 'pair' of leaves in seedling plants.  These seedlings are about 3 weeks old, and today was the first time that I noticed that one of the seedlings was a bit different.  I am not sure if it wanted to be in a different life and be a fan or a helicopter.  I am talking about the seedling top center with the three seedling leaves.  I have never seen 3 cotyledon leaves on a seedling before and decided to share this strange sight with you.</td></tr><tr><td><img src='ariocarpus fissuratus ssp hintonii.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=13 align='right' vspace=0><I>Ariocarpus fissuratus ssp. hintonii</I> comes from a couple of small areas in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi.  The plant was first seen by cactus enthusiast George Hinton in 1984.  The same George Hinton that found the <I>Aztekium hintonii</I>.  The plant was first called <I>Ariocarpus hintonii</I>.  Then some one decided that it is a subspecies of <I>A. fissuratus</I>.  Where <I>A. fissuratus</I> has one furrow with wool in it, <I>A. fiss. ssp. hintonii</I> has 3 furrows.  Only the middle furrow has wool.  It also only grows to 6 cm in diameter in habitat where <I>A. fissuratus</I> can grow to about 21 cm in diameter.  That is for single heads if a clump then the plant can be larger.  The flower is to 4 cm across.</P><P>Like all <I>Ariocarpus</I> they want to be dry over winter.  When watered, water thorough and then let the soil dry before watering again.  The plant, like all good <I>Ariocarpus</I>, blooms in the fall.</td></tr></td></tr></TABLE>");
