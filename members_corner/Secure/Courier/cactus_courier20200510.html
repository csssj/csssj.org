fmart ("Growers Garden","Elton Roberts","","<center><TABLE width='90%'><tr><td valign='top'>About forty years ago, I saw my first <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I> in habitat.  This was just south of Death Valley. I was driving south looking out the windows and relying on my young son's eyes more than mine. It is hard to see what is out on the hills a quarter mile away from the road. My son said he saw something that looked like a cactus like he had not seen before. He saw a few more, and I found a spot to pull over and park. We went for a hike toward a grey clump of something on a hill side. It was maybe three hundred meters from where I parked. Getting closer I could see it was a cactus, and one I had not seen before. I remember being quite impressed, for it was a clump of about five stems, and they were very large compared to any plants I was buying in the nurseries back home. The tallest stem was about knee tall and about 25 to 30 cm in diameter. I did not have a camera along, so no photos, but it did stick in my mind. As we drove slowly along, we saw more and more of the plants. Then almost as fast as we came upon them, they were gone. Maybe I should say we left them behind and saw no more of them on the trip.</P><P>Since then I have seen the plants in quite a few places, and not just a few plants, for in places they were thick almost like a forest. The plants grow in nice clumps north west of Las Vegas Nevada in a large loop around Mount Charleston to the north and to the west and then south to the town of Pahrump. Around Barstow California I gathered some seed on quite large plants there. I have been to Joshua Tree National Park and have enjoyed hiking around and finding the plants down there also. In places, I found <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I> and <I>Escobaria alversonii</I> growing side by side. Sometimes <I>E. alversonii </I>was growing under the large clumps of <I>E. polycephalus</I>. In a few places <I>Echinocereus englemannii</I> and <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I> were arguing over a patch of desert. Many of the clumps were growing in some bushes. You could be almost on a nice clump before seeing it, for it was hidden in a bush that was the same color as the plant. The plants in the southern end of Joshua Tree National Park make small clumps of about only five to about ten stems. These plants can be over knee tall.  Maybe they have to grow that tall to reach the sunshine, because of the bushes they were growing in and beside. There were a few plants growing out in an open place, but, when I inspected them closer, I could see that the bush that use to shade them had died, as only a few stems of it were still there.</P><P>I was in the hills east of Shoshone where I had stopped for the night and went for a walk. There I found <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I> that were over waist tall. I was surprised to see the plants that tall. I went out with the Sclerocactus group from Europe, and, on top of a mountain above Death Valley, there were clumps of <I>E. polycephalus,</I> and they were different from any others I have seen in that the spines were kind of a semi dull silver. They were beautiful clumps; not a lot of them, but enough dotted here and there. If I had been there by myself, I would have investigated them more than I had time to. Another time, I was at the Little Grand Canyon and was hiking around and came across what at first I thought was <I>Echinocactus polycephalus ssp xeranthemoides</I>. I then had to wonder if it was <I>spp. xeranthemoides</I> for some of the plants came up to my mid-thigh. So I am not sure which ones they were, for I always thought that <I>ssp. xeranthemoides</I> was much smaller than <I>ssp. polycephalus</I>. Not more than 20 meters away were clumps that I am sure were <I>ssp. xeranthemoides</I>, for there were eight to twelve stems and they were only to 30 cm tall for the tallest stems.</P><P>Malcomb Burleigh was telling me one time that his sister had been out hiking in the Anza Borrego State Park and had come across some <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I>. Apparently, very few people know that they grow in the park. I have spent an hour looking on the web to see if the plants are mentioned anywhere as being in the park, and I finally found one site. It said there are some <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I> in Palo Verde Wash. It showed where Palo Verde Wash is, but that is in the wrong area from where we found them. When we went to the area, Malcolm had to use a walker to get around. So we went to the area where we could park, and I asked just where these plants were. They pointed out a hill that looked to be quite far off and said that is where we would find them. I thought to myself, &quot;No wonder I have never seen them out here. That hill does not look interesting, and it is a long way up that grade to the base of the hill.&quot; Malcolm and his wife stayed by the vehicle, and his son and I started for the far away hill. Malcolm watched us with binoculars; he did not want to miss out on the fun, even if he could not go there anymore. It took about an hour to reach the hill, and then the climb started. The hill in question was a very steep hill, so a person had to climb it from the end. It was as steep on the back side, and so we were walking kind of a knife blade path.  It is good that the knife blade was dull, for the path was just the rounded top of the blade. The top of that ridge was about several hundred meters long, before it widened out. Looking down on the steep side of the hill were a few clumps of what we were looking for, <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I>. They sure picked a good place to grow, for any one in their right mind would not try climbing down to where the plants were growing.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('1echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg',1011,669)><img src='1echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg' width=303 height=201 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br>The photo to the left is the first clump of <I>Echinocactus polycephalus</I> I came to. I thought it was nice to come upon a large clump for the first plant seen up close. In the photo, it does not look to be on such a steep hill side, but then look at the tree beyond the cactus clump and to the left down the side of the hill. There is no way I could get to that tree, even if I wanted to. One step on those loose rocks, and it was like a 90 meter trip head over heels to the bottom. If I survived, it would be an hour back to the vehicle and a trip to where there was phone service to call an ambulance. So, at least two hours to enjoy thinking why I wanted to reach that tree in the first place. One thing that I observed is that most of the plants I saw were large clumps. The plant stems were only about 25 cm tall for the tallest. The clumps were a meter and more in diameter, but the stems were short compared to the plants farther north in Joshua Tree National Park. I am not sure that there were any stems that were any taller than the 25 cm, and the stems were about 17 or 18 cm in diameter for the largest.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='center'><a href=javascript:poppic('2echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg',1011,669)><img src='2echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg' width=303 height=201 hspace=17 vspace=17 class='enl'></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('3echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg',1011,669)><img src='3echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg' width=303 height=201 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='left' class='enl'></a><br><br>The photo above is a clump just over the edge of the ridge. I wanted to get below the plant and get a photo of it from below, but there was no way I was going to give that a try. The ocotillo behind the clump is about three meters down the hill past the clump. The clump itself is about a meter from the top of the ridge. I figure that the clump is well over a meter in diameter. The photo to the left is a clump that was growing on the other side of the ridge and a short way higher up the ridge. This clump was one of the smaller clumps I encountered and still there were about two dozen stems. I finally got to where there was some flatter land, and there were some really impressive clumps of the plants. The photo below left is a very impressive clump. You are welcome to try and count the number of stems, besides the ones seen here, on the other side there are more not seen in the photo. I have not seen all the plants in habitat, but I think these are by far the largest clumps that I have seen anywhere. That is for the diameter of the clumps and also for the number of stems. The photo below right is another shot of the same clump, but from back a little way.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='center'><a href=javascript:poppic('4echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg',1011,669)><img src='4echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg' width=303 height=201 hspace=17 vspace=17  align='left' class='enl'></a><a href=javascript:poppic('5echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg',1011,669)><img src='5echinocactuspolycephalus.jpg' width=303 height=201 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='center'><br>(To be continued.)</td></tr><tr></TABLE></center>");
