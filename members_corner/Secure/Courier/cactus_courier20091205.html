This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on Saturday, December 5, 2009, from 11:00am to 3:00pm at Harry's Hofbrau.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.

<P>
Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  This will be explained at the dinner so don't worry if you don't understand it now.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Members can bring in their own plants for the auction.  If you are interested, contact Bill Munkacsy at 925-935-5213.
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

fmart ("The Country Store","Peter Beiersdorfer","<center><img src='peter091112a.jpg' width=475 height=244 vspace=7></center><br>During the November meeting we had our Country Store.  This was a fun-filled event.  Members brought succulents, cacti, sweets, and assorted items related to our hobby, such as planting soil, pots, and tools.  We bought tickets and used them on the categories of our choice. Those whose tickets were chosen could select one of the items in that category.  Yours truly bought tickets for the sweets category, and I ended up with lots of yummy deserts.  I don't know who made the banana bread, but it sure was good.  The same was true for the bars made with nuts and cinnamon.  There also were some pillow cases made from cactus print cloth.  Ellen Stubblefield speculated that they were homemade as well.  The plant offerings were many, filling several tables. I am looking forward to the next Country Store.");

fmart ("An introduction to the Amazing, Astonishing <I>Adromischus</I>","Joseph Hidalgo","<img src='adromischus_trigynus_body.jpg' width=280 height=310 align='left' hspace=17><br>The Genera <I>Adromischus</I> is part of the family <I>Crassulaceae</I> which contains many popular plants in succulent collections. Some members in this vast plant tribe include <I>Echeveria</I>, <I>Kalanchoe</I>, <I>Sedum</I>, <I>Dudleya</I>, <I>Crassula</I>, and <I>Cotyledon</I> among others.  Common characteristics found in this family are its dust like seed, ease of propagation from stem or leaf cuttings, and a simple usually small flower arrangement in which the number of stamens (pollen producing part of flower) is equal to the number of petals or is a multiple of them.  Some of my all-time favorite plants are in this family, namely species of <I>Tylecodon</I> and <I>Adromischus</I>.  In this article, I will focus on the latter of the two as they are both deserving of their own space in our club's monthly newsletter.</P><P><I>Adromischus</I> are all from Southern Africa, most coming from RSA and a few species crossing the Orange River in the North West into Namibia.  Plant fanatics collect them for their shapes, markings, and compact habit.  Most species adapt well to bonsai culture, some developing small caudexes over time.  Yet there are a few larger species that don’t fit the bill like <I>A. Maximus</I> with stems growing to over a foot tall.  Flowers are produced annually in the summer on stalks that may be a few inches to over a foot resembling <I>Haworthia</I> inflorences in length and width.  Flowers of most species are petite and delicate with one species in the group, <I>A. Philipsiae</I>, that produces big, fire-orange bell shaped flowers resembling those in the neighboring <I>Crassula</I> family.</P><P>In nature, <I>Adromischus</I> are pollinated by beetles and Sunbirds (South Africa’s answer to Hummingbirds, which can’t hover) and are loaded with nectar.  Recently I went to Michael’s arts and craft store to buy high quality small sable hair brushes for pollinating my <I>Adromischus</I>.  When I started to cross pollinate, I noticed that whole flowers were brimming with nectar!  I made such a mess of the bristles, it looked as if I dipped the brush in clear honey and all the hairs were stuck together.  Not only was each flower loaded, it had made a small offering of nectar underneath each flower.  At the end of the day I was a tad frustrated not knowing if my job at pollinating my plants was successful.  I am taking a wild stab in thinking this small glob could be an attractant for another pollinator, such as an insect, whereas the main reward could be for the bird inside the long tube like flower.  When <I>Adromishcus</I> are in flower, they spend most of their energy in producing the flower stalk, nectar and seed, so you will not get any new growth.  As long as it is warm and your soil is well drained, it will appreciate more water at this time as leaves will generally shrivel faster with flower production.  But be careful when doing so with your <I>A. marianae</I> types, as you can rot them easily this way (as I did last month).  Luckily for us, this rot doesn’t mean we kick ourselves and drop a few F-bombs, it means you will have more plants as they are pretty forgiving, rooting regularly, and making small plants from leaves, albeit slowly but surely.  It always seems like the rarer more expensive the plant the harder to propagate, which is true here as well.  The most attractive expensive forms never seem to be on any growers list or always in short supply.  Even if they are easy to root from broken leaves, growth for some can be painfully slow.  For example, I had an accident with one of my rare <I>A. marianae herrei</I> types in which a leaf broke off.  I was successful in rooting it, and only this year does it look like anything special.  It hung out as a rooted leaf for 2 years, before making 2 more leaves that remained small for 2 years.  This year the plant is a little smaller that a half dollar piece!</P><P>In the late summer as flowers drop or make seed, the plant will generally take a short rest before resuming plant growth.  If you must repot, this is the time to do it, before growth resumes.  For me in south San Jose, slow growth starts in the fall as days shorten and nights cool followed by a short rest in Jan-Feb where very little water should be given to avoid root die off from overly dry soil.  Growing resumes as days warm and nights are cool with rapid growth happening, if you let your plants drink up some of our late winter rain.  All <I>Adromischus</I> love rainwater.  I have witnessed tremendous growth happen in a few short weeks, after I let my plants sit in full late winter heavy rain for 2 days before taking them to dry shelter to let the roots dry.   (This also works with <I>Hoodia</I>, <I>Conophytum</I>, and winter growing <I>Lithops</I>)  If you have leaf propagates, let them get some rain too.  Take caution as all of our soil mixes are different.  Mine happens to be on the lighter side with equal mix ratio aquarium river sand, potting soil, charcoal, pumice, and ground limestone.</P><P><center>(To be continued.)</center>");
