This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on Saturday, December 3, 2016, from 11:00am to 3:00pm at Harry's Hofbrau.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.
<P>
<center><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/390+Saratoga+Ave,+San+Jose,+CA+95129?hl=en" target="_blank"><img src="harryshofbrau.gif" width=559 height=312 alt="390 Saratoga Avenue" border=2></a></center>
</P>
Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Members can bring in their own plants for the auction.  If you are interested, contact Bill Munkacsy at 925-935-5213.
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

When completed, the garden and propagation yard will feature an edible fence comprised primarily of <I>O. ficus-indica</I>, with other <I>Opuntia</I> species interspersed for interest, a shade structure for volunteers to work under covered with <I>Hylocereus</I>, and a hoop house for propagation.  There will also be space within the garden and propagation yard reserved for specimens of other edible cacti or succulents. For more information, or to contribute plants, seeds or cuttings, or volunteer, email <a href='mailto:stuartjrichardson@bountifulchurchyards.org?Subject=Edible%20Cacti%20Garden'>stuartjrichardson@bountifulchurchyards.org</a> or drop by one of BC’s regular Wednesday morning work events.

As I remember the plant was a small thing with maybe three or four heads.  It was so long ago that I do not remember that much about it.  I was not sure that I could keep it alive. But live it did, and I soon had several more plants.  I do not remember where I got them or from what person.  Back in those days, a new plant would be propagated fast as could be so someone could make money.  As I remember, all the plants I saw for sale were only three or four heads.  It was some years before I would see clumps of eight to ten stems for sale.</P><P>It is kind of hard to find a description where <I>M. saboae</I> is described by its self and not with features of subspecies <I>haudeana</I> and <I>goldii</I> included with it.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('mammillariasaboaefls.jpg',1008,810)><img src='mammillariasaboaefls.jpg' width=403 height=324 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a>I have never had a hard time growing the plants that I have had. The plants I have today are from those original plants I bought many years ago.  For me, the plants grow quite quickly compared to many other cactus plants.  When I say I never had a hard time with the plants that is until I only had alkaline water to give them.  They did not like that time in their life.  I did manage to get clumps of quite a few hundred stems.  My clumps filled a 15 cm pot and so I gave them 20.5 cm pots; that is when I ran into trouble.  At first the plants seemed to like their new pot, but then areas of stems started dying.  Before too long most of the plants had areas that had died.  When I discovered that they were dying, I removed what was still alive and gave them their own pots.  Now I had maybe 15 pots, and none of them any larger 9 cm diameter pots.  Most were in smaller pots like 5 and 6 cm diameter.  Even the plants that went into 9 cm pots were only about 6 to 7 cm across.  Those that went into 5 cm pots were single to maybe 3 or 4 stems.  I discovered that the plant tap roots only grow to about 4 cm long at the most.  The tap root has much smaller roots growing out the end and sides, but they did not reach down 10 cm and so the soil below the roots stayed too damp for too long.  Then root rot set in, and many of the plant stems died.  Since then I have used pots that are no more than about 7 cm deep at the most and have had no more problems with the plant.</P><P>The plants grow at an elevation of up to 2,200 meters or 7,218 feet.  At that elevation, they can take a lot of ultraviolet light and it may feel hot but the plants do not like high temperatures.  In habitat, they may have to endure 82 degrees F now and then but not too often.  At that elevation, they can take temperatures down below freezing.  They have endured temperatures to 20 degrees F here.  Keep the soil dry over the winter.  Remember the plants have tap roots, and a 7 cm plant can have about 20 taproots.  If you live where the summer temperatures climb above about 80 F, give the plants afternoon shade.  The plants hate alkaline soil give acidic water to keep the soil acidic.</td></tr></TABLE></center>");

In the early to mid 70s, she lived in Washington, DC.  She, along with her neighborhood friends, took their children to Pennsylvania for outings, and their husbands would join them on the weekends.  Her husband had to take care of the houseplants while she was not at home, and she realized that, among all the plants, the succulents survived.  Eventually she learned that there are two kinds, cacti and non-cactus succulents.  She got interested and joined Washington's Cactus and succulent club.</P><P>Her family later moved to California.  She met Jim Daniel, who had a nursery here, and bought several plants from him.  She met several members of San Jose society in Washington, as some people from our society often went to Washington to judge their shows.  So it was natural that, when Naomi moved to California and started collecting cacti and succulents, she became a member of the CSSSJ.</P><P>She collects more succulents than cactus.  Her favorites are Caudiciforms, <I>Aizoaceae</I>, <I>Lithops</I> and <I>Mesembryanthemum</I>.  She has more than 10,000 varieties.  She has also grown cacti and succulents from seeds and done grafting.</P><P>Naomi has been a housewife and held several jobs along with being a mother to five children.  In Washington, she ran a business taking care of plants for offices like ABC news, which let her set her own time for work.</P><P>She is an art major and picked up gardening on the go.  She was in the first class of Master Gardeners.  She likes all kind of plants and had other collections like stag horn ferns and begonias.  She will be going to Africa next year to see plants there. She is also a member of Monterey Bay society and San Francisco society.</P><P>Naomi was vice president of our society for a few years and helped out with show schedule.
