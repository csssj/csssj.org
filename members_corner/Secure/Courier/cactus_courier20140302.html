<B class="leadhead">Staging and Showing Plants</B><br>
<br>
<P>
Showing plants gives one an opportunity to share with other collectors their special plants.  Everyone learns from the experience both about their own plants and other peoples plants.  One can become creative and come up with clever artistic ideas on how to stage and show off their plants and share their artistic abilities.  The process of showing plants at a show and sale should be a fun experience and a direct hands on way to participate in the hobby. - Bill Munkacsy

Topics to be discussed

He presented a very lively a program on the plants of the Canary Islands, a set of volcanic islands off the coast of Africa, several of which he visited while working in Europe.  Plants he showed included aeoniums, greenovias, euphorbias, and monanthes.  I especially enjoyed seeing  <I>Ceropegia fusca</I>, which is in the <I>Asclepiadaceae</I> and rarely seen.  He also showed the smallest of the aeoniums, <I>A. lindleyi</I>, which reminds me of <I>Aichryson tortuosum</I>.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><img src='jan2014b.jpg' width=400 height=259 hspace=17 vspace=23 align='right'><br><br>Russell also was the featured grower.

fmart("MARK YOUR CALENDAR!","Sonia Dyer","Mark your calendar for Saturday May 17th, when the club will be taking a field trip to visit the greenhouses, conservatory collection, and sales area of the University of California in Davis.  The tour will be hosted by Ernesto Sandoval, succulent expert and popular speaker at our club meetings.  This tour will be in lieu of our regular May meeting.</P><P>We are planning to go by bus, and you will need to bring a bag lunch.  The financial details and pickup points are being finalized and will be announced at the March club meeting.  The Monterey Bay Club is invited to join us.</P><P>If you didn't sign up at the February meeting to reserve a spot on the bus, send your name, phone number, and email address to Sonia Dyer at <a href='mailto:sonia.dyer@sbcglobal.net?Subject=Davis%20Field%20Trip'>sonia.dyer@sbcglobal.net</a>.");

fmart("Our 45th Annual Spring Show &amp; Sale","Peter Beiersdorfer","On April 5 and 6, our 45th Annual Spring Show &amp; Sale will take place at Peterson Middle School.  This is a fun event for all members of our club:  Hands-on fun, wonderful plants, good food, and great company.</P><P>We'll set up on Friday afternoon (April 4), and the club will provide pizza and drinks that evening.  Bring one or more plants to enter in the show.  Entry cards will be provided (more below).  Decorating the show tables and staging the plants is one of the great experiences of the event, as you really get to see the nicest plants up close.</P><P>Of course, come on Saturday and Sunday to view the wonderful plants that are on display.  On Saturday and Sunday, we will have lunch in the court yard.  Bring a side dish, salad, or desert.</P><P>The show will be judged on Saturday morning between 8 and 10 am by four professional judges (two judging cacti and two judging the other types of succulents).  If you want to have firsthand knowledge of what the judges think in making their decision, come for clerking that morning.  Sign up at our March meeting or send an email to Jaan Lepson (jlepson@mac.com) or call Loyd (see number elsewhere in the newsletter or in the CSSSJ roster).  We need four clerks. Clerking is a great opportunity to learn about plants!</P><P>The prize winners will be announced by 10 am on Saturday.  There will be 22 prizes.  Here is a list of the award categories. The highest prize is for the sweepstakes winner based on the total number of points for first, second, and third place entries divided by the greater of 30 or the number of plants entered.  There is a prize for Best Cactus (one award each for Novice, Advanced, Open) and for Best Succulent (one award each for Novice, Advanced, Open).</P><P>Then there are also prizes for Best in Class.  These are given for each of the following cactus categories: <I>Cereinae</I>, <I>Copiapoa</I>, <I>Echinocactinae</I> (other than <I>Mammillaria</I> or <I>Copiapoa</I>), <I>Mammillaria</I>, <I>Echinopsidinae</I>, and <I>Opuntiaceae</I>; and for each of the following succulent categories: <I>Aizoaceae</I> (mesembs), <I>Aloe</I>, <I>Asclepiadaceae</I>, <I>Asteraceae</I> (<I>Compositae</I>), <I>Crassulaceae</I>, <I>Haworthia</I>, <I>Euphorbiaceae</I>, <I>Monocotyledon</I> (other than <I>Aloaceae</I>).</P><P>There is a prize for best photography, and, last but not least, there is the Director/Chair’s award to be given to the entry that the director and chairs feel most deserves recognition but which has not been awarded a prize by the judges.  Our club's website (www.csssj.org) has a listing of the rules governing judging and what are acceptable entries, and which plants belong to which category.</P><P>The sale is a fund raiser for our club, as 30% of the price of any item sold go the club.  This is what supports most of our activities during the year, and a successful sale is highly important for our club's long-term survival.  There are many opportunities to volunteer: Guarding the doors or the plant hotel, helping during setup and teardown, being a cashier or assisting the cashiers, or staffing the club's table in the show area.  Remember that volunteers will get show bucks redeemable for plants.</P><P>You can also sell plants, as we will have a sales table set up for club members who would like to offer a few of their plants for sale.  Contact me by email (beiersdorfer@mac.com) to get a vendor number and instructions on how to sell your plants. You can also simply donate your plants to the club.  In that case, the entire proceeds go to the club.  Bring those plants on Friday evening and let Loyd Monaco or Bill Gingras know that the plants are being donated to the club.  We will price them with barcodes and put them out for sale on Saturday.</P><P>Finally, please bring boxes.  Any size will be okay.  If you can, bring boxes on Friday evening or early Saturday morning. The busiest times are always Saturday morning, and this is when we need the most boxes.  Boxes will also be appreciated on Sunday morning.  Count how many you brought and let Bill Gringras or Jaan Lepson know how many you brought, and they will add 5 cent per box to your show bucks.  If you brought boxes last time and did not receive show bucks for them, mention it to one of them as well, and they will add the amount this time.</P><P>I am very much looking forward to our next show &amp; sale.  I think it will be one of the best we ever had, especially as we work together to make this the fun event it is meant to be.");
