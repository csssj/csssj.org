This year's Holiday Banquet will be held on December 9, 2007, from 11:00am to 4:00pm at <a href="http://www.harryshofbrau.com/">Harry's Hofbrau</a>.  The restaurant is located at 390 Saratoga Avenue near Kiely Boulevard.  Their number is 408-243-0434.

<P>
Everyone who brings a plant puts it on the center table for the plant exchange.  A club officer will select the best plant which will be added to the auction plants.  The person who brought that plant is the first to select from the exchange.  Whoever brought the plant the first person picked picks next, and so forth until all the plants have been taken.  When all the plants are gone, the last person selects a plant from the gift plants.
</P>
<P>
There will be two categories of plants for the auction: plants under $20 and plants over $20.  For the plants under $20 the first person bidding $20 will get the plant.  The auction in this area will be silent; there will be a card next to the plant in which people will bid on the plant.  When time is up, only the top three bidders will be able to bid on the plant. Again the first person to bid $20 will get the plant.  This will be explained at the dinner so don't worry if you don't understand it now.  The plants over $20 will be handled the same way; only on both categories there will be a minimum bid that will be listed and bidding will start from the minimum bid.  Hopefully these changes will speed along the process and bidding.
</P>
<P>
Members who renew at or before the December meeting will participate in a special plant raffle.

An hour seemed like such a long time, and you were grateful to be able to have a whole hour.  Time can be subjective; I don’t care what anyone says.</P><P>When I’m facing a deadline at work, sometimes an hour moves at the speed of light.  I think I have a week to complete something, and then it’s gone.  A magician couldn’t have made it disappear any faster.  When I’m waiting for someone to get something to me that I need, five minutes seem to drag.</P><P>When you’re out with friends and enjoying a lunch, time can fly by.  When we are in the hospital visiting a friend, it drags.

fmart ("NORCAL News","Bill Munkacsy","NORCAL had its meeting Oct 27.  A lot was accomplished and a lot of new changes that should excite individuals and clubs alike are taking place.  A newsletter editor was appointed, Michon Winters from Sacto.  For too long it has been hard to find out what has taken place at NORCAL meetings.  Having a newsletter will change that.  A mission statement will be composed.  It was emphasized at the meeting NORCAL is present to facilitate individuals and clubs to promote the hobby.  Individuals can join and become active.  This is not a vendor club.  It is a club for all interested in the hobby.  Anyone can show plants at the show and receive show bucks for showing plants.  It would be wonderful to have individuals showing plants like at Intercity where they come from hundreds of miles to compete.  For clubs a new important step was agreed upon.  The NORCAL credit card machine will be offered to all clubs to use with the cash registers.  NORCAL only charges $100 and costs for this combined service, a huge bargain for clubs.  NORCAL machines will take credit cards at the shows then give the collected money back to the clubs minus the transaction fees charged by the bank.  This should promote sales at the shows.  Each club in NORCAL is encouraged to set up an educational display to promote the hobby at the annual show and sale and NORCAL will pay each club $100 for their participation.  New state-of-the-art cash registers are in the process of being bought by NORCAL for use at the clubs' Show and Sales.  New board members were elected and appointments made:</P><P><center><TABLE cellpadding=0 cellspacing=3><tr><td nowrap><B>President:</B> Don Cravalho</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td?<td nowrap><B>Vice President:</B> Naomi Bloss</td><tr><tr><td nowrap><B>Treasurer:</B> Roger Lane</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td?<td nowrap><B>Secretary:</B> Karla Munkacsy</td></tr><tr><td nowrap><B>Show Chair:</B> Steve Pate, Naomi Bloss</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td?<td nowrap><B>Sales chair:</B> Bill Munkacsy</td></tr><tr><td nowrap><B>Publicity:</B> Bill Munkacsy and Chuck Breese</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td?<td nowrap></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><B>Board Members:</B> Frank Bloss, Jim Winters, Bill Munkacsy, Elton Roberts, Joene Roberts, Steve Pate</td></tr></TABLE></center></P><P>Next meeting Feb 9 10am at the Munkacsy's.

fmart ("Grower's Garden","Elton Roberts","<img src='neoevansia striata.jpg' width=320 height=280 hspace=16 vspace=0 align='left'>For years, I have missed seeing <I>Neoevansia striata</I> in bloom.  I figured that I just happened to not see it while it was open. Yesterday morning, I was out early checking on something, and there were these flowers hanging out in space.  Now the reason I say &quot;hanging out in space&quot; is that the stems are no more than 5 mm in diameter.  (1/4 inch)  That is measured in the fattest part of the stem.  The flower is 7 cm across.  (2 3/4 inches)  It almost looks like the flowers are floating in space. Now as to why I have not seen it in bloom before is that it is a <I>Neoevansia</I> and as such it opens flowers some time in the night, and within a short time of sunrise the flowers close up and are through blooming.  So, a body has to get out early to see them open.  It is the same for <I>N. viperina</I>.  Although I have seen <I>N. viperina</I> flowers stay open till almost noon.  The sun has been up for one hour, and the single flower open today is now starting to close.</P><P>I have read that the flower is red to purple or reddish-purple as Charles Glass stated.  I have to guess that he did not see the flower open.  Even Edward F. Anderson copied the wrong information in his book as to the color of the flower.  They only saw the outside petals and judged the whole flower color as being that color.  In the side view of the flowers, you can see the reddish-purple outside petals.  When the flowers are not open yet, the whole thing is that color.  When it closes it is again that reddish-purple.  If Anderson had copied W. Hurbert Earl or Lyman Benson or even Brian and Edgar Lamb, he would have got the flower color right.  The correct flower color is white to light pink.</P><P>The plant grows sweet potato-like roots or call them dahlia-like tubers.  The branches can get to about 1 meter long and to 7 mm in diameter.  The plant usually grows under desert shrubs and is quite hard to find.  The stems use shrub stems for support.  As such, it is hard to find unless in bloom.  The plant likes a large diameter pot for its roots.  That makes it look way over potted, but that is the way it goes.  As with any plant that has tuberous roots, you have to have fast draining soil.");
