Naomi Bloss will be our speaker for the September meeting and will be leading her ever-popular and often-requested class on making succulent wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
The club will be providing 11-inch wreath forms stuffed with sphagnum moss and Naomi will be providing the succulent cuttings and expertise. The cost will be $20 per person, cash or check, payable to CSS-SJ.  Only 24 wreath forms will be available, and will be distributed on a first-come first-served basis at the time of the meeting.  Making your wreath now should allow it time to get rooted by the holidays.  You are welcome to bring in cuttings of your own if you wish.
</P>
<P>
Naomi will be bringing plants for sale.

Vendors should make sure to renew their membership every year.</P<P>Our 11th Annual Fall Show &amp; Sale will happen next month.  If you have been a vendor in the past but have not received an invitation letter yet to sell, check with the Club's membership chair, Sandy Carter, to make sure you are still a member of the club.</P><P>Club Members who would like to offer just a few of their plants for sale will again have table space available.  Contact me by email (<a href='mailto:beiersdorfer@mac.com?Subject=Show%20Selling'>beiersdorfer@mac.com</a>) or by postal mail well ahead of the Show &amp; Sale (no later than September 9), if you would like to take advantage of this opportunity.  Every member who wants to sell plants must have a Vendor Number, which I will assign.  Specifically, label your plant with the Vendor Number and price.  Use only whole or half dollar amounts for your prices, such as $3 or $4.50.  Bring your plants on Friday, October 7, during the setup hours (4 pm - 8 pm). Remember - plants must be free of disease and pests.</P><P>If you rather donate some of your plants to the Club instead of selling them, bring them on Friday or Saturday.  We will give the plants a price and barcode, and all proceeds will go directly to the Club.");

If you want help with the wording, I will be glad to help if you can give me the facts.</P><P>Here's what Wes McPheeters has to say about his wonderful Queen of the Night cactus and the photos he sent in.  The photo of him standing next to it gives you a good idea of its huge size.  I especially love the picture of the flower with a big, fat, happy bee in the middle of it!</P><P><center><TABLE width='90%'><tr><td valign='top'>Here is some background on our Queen of the Night.

They are about 10 inches in diameter.  The pollen is a haven for bees!  Buds will take 2-3 days to form on the arms and then one spectacular night they open and stay open for about 18 hours.  It seems to grow all year and does most of the flowering in the summer.  It's also known as Peruvian Apple Cactus and Hedge Cactus.</td></tr><tr><td valign='top'><a href=javascript:poppic('mcph0034b.jpg',529,791)><img src='mcph0034b.jpg' width=362 height=542 hspace=17 vspace=17 align='right' class='enl'></a><br><br> The main plant is the typical cactus dull green color.  It bears magenta-colored egg-shaped edible fruit.  The succulent fruit pulp is sweet with crunchy seeds.  We will definitely sample it this year.</P><P>This cactus was just a random purchase a few years ago.  It was bought in a 4x4 pot and, a couple of years later, transferred to a 6&quot; pot.  For a while, it was a failure to thrive, which I now attribute to the fact that the pot was in a shady location on our deck and probably overwatered.  The plant was about 12 inches tall, when it was transplanted into the ground in a neglected area near our trash cans.</P><P>Totally neglected, it took off - thriving in a sunny location and currently 10 ft tall.  It adds 2-3 feet each year.  The book says the plant will grow 20+ feet tall.  It has 6 inch diameter arms, and is listing 15 degrees.  I believe it is easily propagated.  Sunny location and neglect does wonders for this cactus!  Two other cactus plants we have are similarly thriving.</td></tr></TABLE></center>");
