<B><P>Total Number of People Needed -</B> Six</P>

<B><P>Starting Date and Time - </B>Friday, March 30, 2012, 3:30pm</P>

<B><P>Duration - </B>3 hours</P>

<B><P>Duties -</B> You'll be needed to help arrange and set up tables in the show and sale areas, as per the plan decided upon by the show and sale committee.  Once tables are arranged, you'll help &quot;dress&quot; the tables in the show area, that is, cover them with paper and plastic skirting, and set out the category dividers and category markers.</P>

<B><P>Benefits -</B> Aside from being a good reason to leave work early on Friday, being on site before the sale is open to the public gives you the opportunity to shop early for plants, procuring those one-of-a-kind desirable specimens that might not be around very long after the sale opens.  The club also provides dinner on Friday night, typically consisting of sandwiches, pizza, and soft drinks.</P>

<B><P>Total Number of People Needed -</B> Six</P>

<B><P>Starting Date and Time - </B>Friday, March 30, 2012, 7:30pm</P>

<B><P>Duration - </B>1.5 hours</P>

<B><P>Duties -</B> Prior to 7:30 pm on Friday, entrants bring their plants into the show area and set them out in categories as pre-arranged by the set-up crew.  Since there is no way of predicting the number of plants that will be entered in a given category, some categories appear crowded while others look empty.</P>
<B>
</B><P>It is the duty of the staging crew to redistribute the show plants so that they are more evenly spaced out, and grouped by entry class (novice, advanced, open) within each category, without disturbing the original orientation of each plant as placed by the entrant.</P>

<B><P>Total Number of People Needed -</B> Six</P>

<B><P>Starting Date and Time - </B>Saturday, March 31, 2012, 7:45am</P>

<B><P>Duration - </B>Approximately 2.5 hours</P>

<B><P>Duties -</B> The clerks facilitate the judging process. There are two teams of clerks; one for cactus and one for succulents. Each team of clerks typically consists of three people - two &quot;punchers&quot; and a runner. As the judges mark the folded entry card for each plant, the &quot;punchers&quot; punch through the card at the judge's mark, cut the folded card in two, hand one of the halves to the runner, and award a ribbon as is appropriate. The runner collects the cards and delivers them to the tabulator, who is busy tabulating points.</P>

<B><P>Benefits -</B> Clerking provides a great opportunity to see what the judges are looking for as they are judging the plants.  You are right there next to them and can hear their comments, etc.  Also, if you arrive early enough before the judging starts, you still have the opportunity to procure those one-of-a-kind desirable specimens that might not be around very long after the sale opens.  Coffee and donuts are provided for you if you have not had breakfast, or just want a snack</P>

<B><P>To sign up as a Clerk -</B> Send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@csssj.org?Subject=Clerk">webmaster@csssj.org</a>, or call Bill Gingras at 408-981-5904 and leave a message.  <I>Please be sure to specifically mention that you are signing up as a Clerk.</P>

<B>
<P>Benefits -</B> Aside from being a chance to rest your feet if you've been volunteering other positions, the club really needs well-staffed security to ensure that the show plants are safe.</P>
