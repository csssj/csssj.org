<B><P>Starting Date and Time - </B>Friday, September 20, 2019, 3:30pm</P>

<B><P>Duration - </B>3 hours</P>

<B><P>Duties -</B> You'll be needed to help arrange and set up tables in the show and sale areas, as per the plan decided upon by the show and sale committee.  Once tables are arranged, you'll help &quot;dress&quot; the tables in the show area, that is, and cover them with paper and plastic skirting.</P>

<B><P>Benefits -</B> Aside from being a good reason to leave work early on Friday, being on site before the sale is open to the public gives you the opportunity to shop early for plants, procuring those one-of-a-kind desirable specimens that might not be around very long after the sale opens.  The club also provides dinner on Friday night, typically consisting of sandwiches, pizza, and soft drinks.</P>

<B><P>Duties -</B> Prior to 6:30 pm on Friday, entrants bring their plants into the show area and set them out. Since in the Fall show there are no designated categories to arrange the plants into, it is the duty of the staging crew to redistribute the show plants so that they are more evenly spaced out without disturbing the original orientation of each plant as placed by the entrant.</P>
