</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Entering plants into the CSSSJ show is easy.  The following explains how.</P>

</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Choose the class that you would like to exhibit your plants in.</P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Most people reading this will likely be entering plants in the Novice class, but you can compete in one of the following three classes.</P>


<UL>
<I><LI>NOVICE</I> - If you are under 18, have not won a total of 50 first place ribbons in previous CSSA-affiliated shows, or have been competing for less than 5 years in CSSA-affiliated shows, you can exhibit in this class.</LI>
<I><LI>ADVANCED</I> - You must exhibit in this class if you no longer qualify for the above class.</LI>
<I><LI>OPEN</I> - If you possess or have possessed a nurseryman's license or earn a substantial income from the sale of plants, you must exhibit in this class.</LI></UL>


<P>The classes are lower limits - anyone can move up.</P>

</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Choose the plants you would like to enter.</P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>You can enter into the show any plant that has been in your possession for six or more months.  Plants that are entered in the show should be clean, free of scarring, bugs, spider webs, and pesticide odors.  The judges cannot rotate a plant on the table to look at it from all sides, so actually, if you have a plant that has a good side and a not-so-good side, you can still enter it.</P>

<P>Though a fancy pot is not necessary, the plant should be nicely potted and the pot should be clean.</P>

</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Obtain a copy of the show rules and categories, and some entry cards.</P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Read and understand the show rules.</P>

<P>The latest version of the show rules and categories document can be obtained at the meetings preceding the show, by <a href="show_ruless2017.pdf" target="_blank">clicking here</a>, or at the show site on the Friday night before the show opens.  Entry cards can be obtained at the meetings preceding the show, or at the show site on the Friday night before the show opens (entry cards are not available online).</P>

<P>After reading the rules, determine the divisions and categories in which you will be entering your plants.  This information can be determined from the show rules and categories document.  For example, suppose you have a nice <I>Euphorbia mitriformis</I> that you would like to enter.  Turn to the genus cross-reference on page 7 of the show rules and categories document, and find that the categories for <I>Euphorbia</I> are 35.1 through 35.6.  Find those categories in the categories listings which are on pages 3 through 6 of the document (the <I>Euphorbia</I> categories happen to be on page 5).  Looking over the various <I>Euphorbia</I> categories, you decide your <I>Euphorbia mitriformis</I> is shrubby, rather than medusiod, caudiciform, globose, columnar, or milliform, so you decide to enter it in category 35.5, "Euphorbia - shrubs."</P>

</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Fill out the entry cards.</P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>There are enough entry cards per sheet of paper for six plants.  Fill out one entry card per plant.  The following shows how the card might be filled out for our <I>Euphorbia mitriformis</I>:</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>After filling out the cards, <I>fold</I> them on the dashed line.<I>  Do not cut them on the dashed line.</P>
</I>
</FONT><B><U><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P>Bring your plants to the show between 5:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Friday evening.</P>
</B></U></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial">
<P>Place them out on the show tables in the appropriate categories so that their best side faces out.  Place the <I>folded</I> entry tags under the pots so that <I>your</I> name (not the plant's name) is concealed, as in this picture:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="image2.jpg" WIDTH=334 HEIGHT=348></P>

<P>That's all there is to it!  You do not even have to attend the show.  You'll just have to come by and pick up your plants and (possibly!) your awards on Sunday evening.  Remember, as stated in the rules, you cannot remove your plants from the show area until after 4:00 pm Sunday evening.</P>
