MINI SHOW:  Kathi made new large color coded signs for the mini-show; each of the four categories a different color. Right off the bat, these signs made it real clear to members which tables to place their plants on. Thanks, Kathi!
</P>
<P>
SPRING SHOW:  The 2009 Show and Sale will be held on April 4&amp;5 at Buchser School in Santa Clara. Bill M. to send out the vendor letters. Bill K. to line up judges. We may need to order more tables. We don’t have anyone to organize and run the BBQ this year, so we will need to provide some fast food alternative for the Saturday and Sunday afternoon meal break. Tony has printed out the postcards, which the club will put labels and stamps on at next month’s meeting.
</P>
<P>
FALL SHOW:  Oct. 3&4 at Buchser School. Bill K. to contact the school to reserve the space. We never did receive a bill for the custodial services that the school provided to us last fall. <B><I>A motion was proposed and approved</I></B> to award Buchser School what would have been a $320 custodial bill plus the percentage from our sale profits to equal a $520 donation to their Science department.

</P>
<P>
BY-LAWS:  Linda and Sandy have volunteered to spearhead the updating of our Operating Procedures and our By-Laws. This process is open to any club member that might be interested.
