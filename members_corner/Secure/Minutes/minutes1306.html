Attending: Bill Kurtz, Roger Lane, Kathi Cambiano, Joel Parker, Sonia Dyer, Alex Morgan

<P>
Called to order at 10:45AM.
  </P>
<P>
Roger handed out the Treasurer's report covering the last show, and the Lotusland trip.
</P>
<P>
Lengthy discussion of likely dissolution of NorCal and disposition of their cash registers.  NorCal will send out a letter to the clubs if they decide to dissolve.    Either way our cash register rental fees will go up by some amount.   If they dissolve, it would have to be determined which club gets responsibility for the registers, and possibly each club would have to have its own expert on the cash registers.
</P>
<P>
Bill talked to the principal secretary at Buchser on Friday, and they still don't know when their meeting room will be demolished, but that it would NOT be available for our fall show, and might take 2 years for the reconstruction to be complete.    Bill hasn't talked to Peterson again yet, but rumor has it that their facility upgrade is going well.   Bill plans to contact Peterson tomorrow and will let us know what he finds out.
</P>
