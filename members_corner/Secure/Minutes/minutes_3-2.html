<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LAST MONTH’S MINUTES for the Board of Directors Meeting on February 2, 2003 were approved.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TREASURER: The balance as of March 2, 2003, is $6,291.36.  Sales tax in the amount of $1,245.00 has been paid to the state.  Judy also applied for and received an ATM account and card in the club's name.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MEMBERSHIP: Membership director Sandy Carter reported that 16 new-members/renewals have been received in the past month.  The CSSSJ has 99 paid members as of 3/2/03.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HOSPITALITY: <I>Nothing new to report.  </I>Bill Kurtz will remain the interim hospitality director as we try to find a volunteer to take over the position.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PROGRAM: Program chair Bill Kurtz continues exploring possibilities for future programs.  We will not be having an April meeting this year, because of the annual show and sale.  The May program will be by Walter Teague on succulent gardening.  A slide or "projected digital photography" program by Karl Fredricks is a possibility for the June program.  Other programs are to-be-determined.  Bill noted that we will have to change the October meeting date because Prusch Park will be having its "Fall Festival" on our regular meeting date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LIBRARY: <I>(old)</I> Club librarian, Lori Habib, is in the process of setting up a place to store the library materials.  Much of the materials have been transferred to her, and the final transfer of materials is expected soon.  She plans to update the master list of books (a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), and will continue bringing in sample books to display at the meetings.  The club is considering auctioning some of the older non-reference books, or selling them, as at a show and sale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(new)</I> Rowena presented a new book, "Simon &amp; Schuster Guide to Cacti and Succulents." <I>The board voted on and <B>approved</B></I> purchase of two copies for the library.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFFILIATE: Our annual membership to Guadalupe Gardens, with a donation of $50, has now been paid.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MINI SHOW: <I>Nothing new to report.  </I>The Mini-Show is being held before the Program. Paul Long will be submitting a series of articles for the Courier, to explain and promote the mini-show.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANNUAL SHOW: <I>(old)</I> A proof of insurance has been sent to the school. The show and sales committees met during the month (February) to discuss pressing issues related to the annual show/sale, and a list of "to be done" items was generated and sent out by Bill Munkacsy.  Kathy Hendig will be making the pots that we will be giving out as awards this year.  Bill K duplicated the flyers and handbills, and brought them to the meeting to hand out.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(new/updated)</I> Press releases, etc., have been sent out.  Bill K has now recruited all four judges.  The Saturday night banquet will be held at the same place as last year.  We will be collecting addresses for a mailing list via personal checks, a "guest book" at the register, and a raffle at the show (entrants must provide name/address to enter).  Don C will give out handbills at the Prusch Park tomato extravaganza, and we will have a stack of handbills available at the University of Santa Clara horticultural event.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(action items)</I> Rowena suggested having an "apprentice judge" program (we will pursue this idea).  Bill K to approach the Santa Clara school district with a proposal that we be allowed to post flyers, banners, etc., on district property.  A list of addresses is still needed for the postcards, and the postcards still need to be duplicated and sent out.  Bill will reserve the Chinese restaurant for the Saturday night banquet.  The show/sale committee will be meeting one last time via phone conference to hash out any remaining details.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BY-LAWS: <I>Nothing new to report. </I>It is urged that all Board members start taking notes, outlining their responsibilities.  Concerns range from too many vendors running the club; not enough new and younger members; the number of terms that can be served; and the By-Laws being hard rules versus a guideline approach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OLD BUSINESS: <I>(updated)</I> Bill Gingras has finished the "first draft" of the club’s website, and moved it to <I>www.csssj.org</I>. It is currently up for review at that URL. <I>Suggestions are very welcome.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW BUSINESS:<I> </I>Joel Parker got 50 CSSSJ logo shirts made up in various sizes and three colors, for a total of $488.75.  The cost per shirt to the club is $9.77.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting was adjourned at 12:10 P.M.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next Board meeting will be on May 4, 2003, at the Prusch Park Meeting Hall at 10:30 A.M.</P>
