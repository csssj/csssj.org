LAST MONTH’S MINUTES for the Board of Directors Meeting on July 12, 2009, <I><B>were approved.</B></I>
</P>
<P>
TREASURER:  The balance as of July 12, 2009 is approx. $16,900.
</P>
<P>
MEMBERSHIP:  With renewals, the total membership is now 98 people. 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITALITY:  Thanks to the Anthony and Vicki Ortiz for helping out with this function!
</P>
<P>
The September PROGRAM will be a presentation by Ernesto Sandoval on his trip to South Africa in 2008. Mr. Sandoval is the curator of the UC Davis Botanical Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
LIBRARY:  It was brought up that we need to include an e-link in our courier directing people to our library list of book titles.
</P>
<P>
AFFILIATE: Linda has stepped in as our club affiliate until a new person assumes this role. She has contacted the CSSA for general information on contacts and services. Linda has also reached out to other N. Californian club affiliates for general info on what their responsibilities are. Should there be a term limit for this position?
</P>
<P>
MINI SHOW:  Kathi will be trying a new method for the voting. Due to timing issues with having some members coming in late and wanting to vote, and the program timing of the guest speakers, we will start use the &quot;honor system&quot; for voting. Each person will be given 8-votes each, and during the meeting, Kathi will announce the cut-off time for voting, rather than waiting for all the club events to finish before voting for the mini-show. 
</P>
<P>
SPRING SHOW:  Because Easter is on April 4, 2010, we are looking into having our Spring show on April 10 &amp; 11. Bill K. will check with Buchser School if these dates can be booked.
</P>
<P>
FALL SHOW:  Oct. 3 &amp; 4 at Buchser School. Bill K. has reserved the space. 
</P>

<li>Sonia submitted a well thought out report on &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; from the Spring Show and Sale this last April. There are many points that can be incorporated into our By-Laws.</li>
<li>In discussion of our club’s position on &quot;good-will&quot; donations, there needs to be language and limit descriptions around this process to ensure being fair to all members of our club.</li>
<li>We need to determine where within our website the By-Laws should reside.</li>

<li>A $5 show bucks reward was suggested for those receiving e-couriers, although it has not been determined yet just how the member will receive the reward. – <I>Our newsletter editor, Rich Kroll, and Linda have been implementing the conversion to electronic format very well.</I></li>

<tr><td nowrap valign="top">NEW BUSINESS:</td></tr><tr><td>
<UL>
<li>Kathi spearheaded discussion on how we advertise for upcoming shows and the use of guest speakers from within our own club. Perhaps we could start a process a couple of weeks in advance of our upcoming shows for reaching out to the public. Advertising in newspapers doesn’t reach as large an audience any more. But speakers at Libraries or community rooms for school kids may reach more. We could offer free plants to those who show up.</li>
