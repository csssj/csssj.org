LAST MONTH'S MINUTES for the Board of Directors Meeting:   <br>
Approved with the correction of the Treasurer' report to reflect approx: $12,000.00. Roger will get the correct balance. <br>
Linda didn't remember the part of the old business that said that she would look into a &quot;getting to know you&quot; information package. Chuck will pursue this idea.
</P>
<P>
TREASURER: Roger will supply Sandy with the correct balance. He thinks it is about $12,000.00. It was moved by Bill M and seconded by Chuck to have a more visible 
Treasurers report available either in the newsletter, on the Internet site or available at the meetings. The motion was approved and the details will be worked out. This would be a general report.<br>
We will take a look at the credit cards or PayPal for our show. Several venders felt that we were hurt by not having the credit cards available.<br>
After much discussion it was moved by Linda, seconded by Bill M and approved that we would give Buchser Middle School 10% of our profit from the Show and Sale. This amount was $440.00. Bill K will deliver the check to the school.<br>
</P>
<P>
MEMBERSHIP:  We have several new members bringing the total membership to over 100. Sandy will report next month.
</P>
<P>
HOSPITALITY:  Bill K is okay with chairing this as long as he is able to get some help. Thanks, Bill. You were missed.

<P>
LIBRARY:  Nothing new to report.
</P>
<P>
AFFILIATE: 	Linda will call Carole and see if she has anything that the group should know about. We will see what we can do about getting into the calendar for the Journal. Tony and Linda will work on this.
</P>
<P>
MINI SHOW:  This is going well. Linda and Bill M will look at the format for next year. We may cancel the months that there is a &quot;hands on&quot; event because of timing issues.
</P>
<P>
ANNUAL SHOW:  Bill G and Judy will be the Show chairs and Linda D and Bill M will be the Sale chairs. Linda will not be at the Show and Sale on Saturday, due to a reunion. We have looked at ways to maximize the table situation. We will start to put out the word for volunteers. (Reminding everyone to submit plants to the show and helping out with set-up, tear-down, security, cash register, boxing, information, and misc) Remind everyone about the pot-luck and the show bucks.<br>
Bill K mentioned that we need to start thinking about April 2009 because of an Easter conflict.
Chuck shared information about his artists club and that they were not making a large profit because of overhead and over commitments with their funds. We will now base our donation to the Buchser Middle School based on a 10% of our profit.

NEW BUSINESS:  There were many questions about Norcal. Who is accountable? Some of the board members will see what they can find out. (credit cards?)<br>
