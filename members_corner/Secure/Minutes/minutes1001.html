</P>
<P>
TREASURER:  The balance as of January 1, 2010, is approx. $16,335.
</P>
<P>
MEMBERSHIP:  With renewals, the total membership is now 121 people. We need to review the benefits packet that we provide to new members.
</P>
<P>
HOSPITALITY:  Thanks to the Anthony and Vicki Ortiz for helping out with this function!

</P>
<P>
The February PROGRAM will be a presentation on Dudleyas by Steve McCabe, coordinator of Research and Education and Curator of Succulents for the Arboretum in UC Santa Cruz. He will be bringing in plants for sell.
</P>
<P>
LIBRARY:  <I>Nothing new to report.</I>
</P>
<P>
AFFILIATE: Linda and Tony have stepped in as our club affiliate until a new person assumes this role. The paperwork for the CSA membership has been submitted. We need the publicity in their journals for our upcoming shows in April and in October. The 2010 California Garden insurance for our club meeting room needs to be paid.
</P>
<P>
MINI SHOW:  Last year, Kathi tried a new method for the voting. Due to timing issues with having some members coming in late and wanting to vote, and the program timing of the guest speakers, we started using the &quot;honor system&quot; for voting. Each person was given 8-votes each, and during the meeting, Kathi would announce the cut-off time for voting, rather than waiting for all the club events to finish before voting for the mini-show. She is looking into using new forms to make the voting process easier for everyone.
</P>
<P>
SPRING SHOW:  Because Easter is on April 4, 2010, we will be having our Spring show on April 10 &amp; 11. Bill K. has reserved the space at Buchser School.
</P>
<P>
FALL SHOW:  Oct. 3 &amp; 4 at Buchser School. Bill K. has reserved the space.

</P>
<P>
BY-LAWS:  Sonia has volunteered to spearhead the updating of our Operating Procedures and our By-Laws. We need to determine where within our website the By-Laws should reside.
</P>
<P>
OLD BUSINESS: <I>nothing to report</I>
</P>
<P>
NEW BUSINESS: Kathi has been working with Rich on some new ideas for our web-site. We’re thinking of a photo archive area, and even maybe a Facebook account.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was adjourned at 12:10 P.M.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting will be on February 7, 2010, at the Prusch Park Meeting Hall at 10:30 A.M.
