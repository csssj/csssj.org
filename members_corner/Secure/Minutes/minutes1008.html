<P>
<B>LAST MONTH’S MINUTES</B> for the Board of Directors Meeting on July 11, 2010, were reviewed with one correction, but not voted on. Under the category of New Business, Bill Munkacsy is not resigning from the club, and it should read: Past President Bill Munkacsy has resigned from the CSSSJ Board of Directors.
 </P>
<P>
<B>TREASURER:</B>  The balance as of June 30, 2010, is approx. $21,390.
</P>
<P>
<B>MEMBERSHIP:</B>  One new member. With renewals, the total membership is 155 people.
</P>
<P>
<B>HOSPITALITY:</B>  Thanks to Anthony and Vicki Ortiz for helping out with this function!
</P>
<P>
The September <B>PROGRAM</B> will be a presentation by guest speaker Rebecca Schoenenberger of California Nativescapes, on how to create a successful drought tolerant landscape using California native plants, cactus, and succulents.
</P>
<P>
<B>LIBRARY:</B>  There has been a steady stream of interest from our new members. Linda indicates that most of the books she brings get checked out.
</P>
<P>
<B>AFFILIATE:</B> The 46<sup>th</sup> annual CSSA show will be in San Diego on April 24-29, 2011. We may look into having a group trip there if enough interest.
</P>
<P>
<B>MINI SHOW:</B>  Kathi is revising the logistics, and will be setting per person limits; looked at will be the number of categories and number of votes. She would like to have this activity run as a committee and if anyone is interested in participating, please contact her. She is looking for new ideas and suggestions for next year, and will be running a survey in next month’s courier.
</P>
<P>
<B>SPRING SHOW:</B>  Bill Gingras has volunteered to be our new Show and Sale chair, and will act as the umbrella that oversees all aspects of the show part of the event and the vendor part. Roger has volunteered to review and update our vendor letter. Peter volunteered to organize and run the sale side. Jaan and Kathi volunteered to organize and run the show side. Tony and Kathi have volunteered to spearhead publicity for our events, i.e. postcard mailings, newspaper and email postings. We are looking for someone to organize and run the security aspects of both the show and sale. There is some ambiguity about the number of show plants and volunteer time that is required for plant and pottery vendors. This August’s meeting time was largely devoted to discussing these issues and the need for the sales side and the show side to meld more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
<B>FALL SHOW:</B> We still want to move forward with having the Fall show. Oct. 3 &amp; 4 at Buchser School. Bill K. has reserved the space. The Fall show is People’s Choice. It was suggested to expand the show to include photos, dish gardens, and other art categories.

<B>BY-LAWS:</B> Sonia submitted a revised Process #3 for review. One of the next processes, or cheat-sheets, to have documented is for the cash register functions at our sales events.
</P>
<P>
We need to determine where within our website the By-Laws should reside:
