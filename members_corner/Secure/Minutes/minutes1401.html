Roger to send out a revised show and sale checklist per the inputs he received at the meeting at Sonia's house.

Per Bill we still haven't received the Buchser custodian bill ($320) from the spring show.

<P>
Sale vendor split is currently 70/30.  Roger's computer died last year so he doesn't have statistical data he usually would be able to put together for past shows re where our breakeven point is.   Roger to contact Naomi to get a feel for the split that other clubs have.

<dt>Program Schedule:</dt>
<dd>We need to book speakers/activities for next year.   The February 2 meeting will start at 12 and end at 2 because of the Super Bowl.  There will be no minishow in February.   We'll have a favorite plant discussion as the program.   Loyd suggested that the March show be a presentation by show judges on what they look for when judging the show.  Loyd will see if Naomi is available.  April 5 &amp; 6 is still the date for the spring show at Peterson.<br>
Discussion of having a field trip next spring to UC-Davis.   The Monterey Bay Club would be invited to join us.   Roger and Bill to call Earnesto to see if May would work.  Depending on how the dates work out, this could be a substitute for our May meeting.   If we're going to have a field trip in May, we need to be able to discuss it with the club members by the March meeting.</dd>
