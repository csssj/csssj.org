<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LAST MONTH’S MINUTES were not typed up by the Bill G, however, the board discussed his notes.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TREASURER: The balance as of March 7, 2004, is $5152.87.  A few bills are outstanding.</P>

<P>MEMBERSHIP: The CSSSJ has 98 paid members as of March 7, 2004.  A few of them have not yet paid, but they do every year so membership made the decision to include them in the roster.</P>

<P>HOSPITALITY: <I>Nothing new to report.  </I>Bill Kurtz will remain the interim hospitality director as we try to find a volunteer to take over the position.  The group agreed that the club needs to more aggressively find someone to take over this position.</P>

<P>PROGRAM: The CSSSJ annual Show and Sale is in April.  Roger Lane is a possible presenter at the May meeting.  The program for the June and August meetings is to be determined.  A tour of Mary Parisi's growing operation is a possibility for July.  Woody Minnich will be the presenter at the September meeting.  The September and October meetings will be on the second Sunday of the month.  Also, the May meeting might be on the second Sunday due to Cinco de Mayo.</P>

<P>LIBRARY: We now have all of the library materials.  Linda Delgado is the new club librarian.</P>

<P>AFFILIATE: <I>Nothing new to report.</P>
</I>
<P>MINI SHOW: <I>Nothing new to report.</P>
</I>
<P>ANNUAL SHOW: Many topics were discussed in preparation for the April show and sale.</P>

<P>OLD BUSINESS: <I>None.</P>
</I>
<P>NEW BUSINESS: Don Cravalho will set out flyers at Prusch Park's Spring Garden Market on April 3rd.  Buchser Middle School will be having a Spring Sale and Gardener's Market on May 1st.  It costs nothing to have an informational booth at that event.  Bill Kurtz is to give a talk on cacti and succulents at Guadalupe Gardens the week before our show and sale.  He will hand out flyers at that event.</P>

<P>The next Board meeting will be on May 2nd, 2004, at the Prusch Park Meeting Hall at 10:30 A.M., unless decided otherwise.</P>
