<B>LAST MONTH’S MINUTES</B> for the Board of Directors Meeting on August 1, 2010, were reviewed but not voted on.
</P>
<P>
<B>TREASURER:</B> The balance as of June 30, 2010, is approx. $21,390.
</P>
<P>
<B>MEMBERSHIP:</B>  One new member. Total 156 members.
</P>
<P>
<B>HOSPITALITY:</B> Thanks to Anthony and Vicki Ortiz for helping out with this function!
</P>
<P>
The November <B>PROGRAM</B> will be a hands-on Potting Workshop of succulent plants given by member Naomi Bloss.
</P>
<P>
<B>LIBRARY:</B>  There has been a steady stream of interest from our new members. Linda indicates that most of the books she brings get checked out.
</P>
<P>
<B>AFFILIATE:</B> The 46<sup>th</sup> annual CSSA show will be in San Diego on April 24-29, 2011. We may look into having a group trip there if enough interest.
</P>
<P>
<B>MINI SHOW:</B> Last month, a non-member showed their plants, prompting Kathi to design and provide a sign with the mini-show rules on it.
</P>
<P>
<B>SPRING SHOW:</B>  As we have put in place new positions overseeing the show and sale events, we are now looking for someone to organize and run the security aspects. For Spring of 2011, we will hold our event at Buchser School. The school facilities will not be available for the Fall 2011 Show and Sale, nor will it be available for all of  2012 due to upgrades being performed at the school. We will be looking for a new venue.
</P>
<P>
<B>FALL SHOW:</B> The Board of Directors spent the first one hour of this meeting placing address labels and stamps on approximately 700 postcards for sending out in the mail to advertise our 2010 Fall Show and Sale on October 2 &amp; 3.

</P>
<P>
<B>BY-LAWS:</B>We need to determine where within our website the By-Laws should reside:

</P>
<P>
<B>NEW BUSINESS:</B> All of the club officers and chair positions are coming up for renewal at the end of the year. Linda will be spearheading the nomination process.
