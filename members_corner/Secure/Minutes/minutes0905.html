The June PROGRAM will be a presentation on how to Grow and Show plants by Chuck Breese and Bill Munkacsy.  Each person who comes to the June meeting will receive a small 2” pot of the same species plant, Mammillaria spinosissima. You can repot it, and then bring the plant back to our Fall Show and Sale and enter it into the People’s Choice (or other committee yet to be established) show category. Additionally, at the June program, we will be exchanging tips and advice about cultivation tools. Bring your tools in, or bring in a picture to share.

LIBRARY:  It was brought up that we need to include an e-link in our courier directing people to our library list of book titles.

AFFILIATE: Carole Keeton, our affiliate, passed away from a tragic auto accident on April 21. Her husband, Sam, sustained injuries also. Many of us knew her as a good friend, and will miss her presence. We will be looking for a new person to fill this responsibility. Carol enjoyed doing this for many years for our club. Should there be a term limit for this position? Other business - The payments have been sent in for the California Gardeners Club insurance.

MINI SHOW:  Maybe have three divisions within each major category? Kathi has made decorative dividers for the tables to separate the different parts. With the signs she made previously, it invites people to participate. Thanks, Kathi!!

<li>Our profit from the sale after expenses were paid out was $3,100.</li>
<li>For the set-up night, we could have done a better job in breaking out and assigning the various tasks so as to more effectively involve everyone who came to help.</li>
<li> We ran out of food to feed all the Friday night helpers. This is the second year in a row that this has happened, and we will have to look at it more closely next year.</li>
<li> Some of the vendors had concerns regarding the number and layout of the sale tables, and the percentage of profit.</li>
<li> One of the cash registers did not work, and perhaps should have been tested beforehand. We need to get a set of operating instructions to have on hand.</li>
