<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LAST MONTHâ€™S MINUTES for the Board of Directors Meeting on March 2, 2003 were approved.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TREASURER: The balance as of May 4, 2003, is $10,358.22, however, a few of the vendors had not yet cashed their checks.  Not included in the balance is $75.00 from new members, and $123.00 in tee-shirt sales at the show.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MEMBERSHIP: The club acquired a few new members who signed up at the show &amp; sale, and one via the on-line application.  The CSSSJ has 103 paid members as of 5/4/03.  Membership director Sandy purchased a laminating machine for name badges.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HOSPITALITY: <I>Nothing new to report.  </I>Bill Kurtz will remain the interim hospitality director as we try to find a volunteer to take over the position.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PROGRAM: Program chair Bill Kurtz continues the never-ending job of procuring speakers for our meetings.  Bill Munkacsy will be presenting a slide-show and talk about his recent trip to the Sonoran desert at the June meeting.  The program for the July meeting is to-be-determined, however, the club typically holds a poker run, BBQ, or field trip during that month.  The program for the August and September meetings are TBD.  In October, Mark Muradian (sp?) will be giving a program on extreme landscaping using heavy equipment.  Bill K also has four or five other phone calls and emails out as he prospects for other speakers.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(old)</I> We will have to change the October meeting date because Prusch Park will be having its "Fall Festival" on our regular meeting date.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LIBRARY: <I>(new)</I> Club librarian, Lori Habib, might have to find a temporary home for the library collection as she might be remodeling her house.  The club now has two new books for the collection: "Cycads of the World," and "Crassula, a Growers Guide."  The club will be purchasing two new books: "Simon &amp; Schuster Guide to Cacti," and "Simon &amp; Schuster Guide to Succulents."  (<I>Clarification -</I> The March minutes mentioned these as one book, "Simon &amp; Schuster Guide to Cacti <U>and</U> Succulents.")</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(old)</I> Much of the library collection has been transferred to Lori, and the final transfer of materials is expected soon.  She plans to update the master list of books (a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet), and will continue bringing in sample books to display at the meetings.  The club is considering auctioning some of the older non-reference books, or selling them, as at a show and sale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFFILIATE: <I>Nothing new to report.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MINI SHOW: <I>Nothing new to report. </I> Paul Long will be submitting a series of articles for the Courier, to explain and promote the mini-show.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANNUAL SHOW: All board members agreed that the Show &amp; Sale was a success, taking in $16,755.25 after taxes.  Due to a variety of factors that were different from previous years (change of date, Mercury News article, post cards, etc.), it is not possible to determine the affect any one factor had on attendance and sales.  Of the &gt;470 $1-off post cards that were sent out, only 28 came back, but Bill and Joan got several phone inquiries.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The raffle tags, "guest list" sign-up sheet, and credit card registry are missing, so an article needs to be run in the next Courier asking if anyone has them and asking for them to be returned.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(action items for next year)</I> Look into an "apprentice judge" program.  Compile a mailing list, once all lists, tags, etc., have been located.  Investigate and update (as pertinent) the "show rules" list per suggestions (alphabetical cross-reference, change "Best Liliaceae" category to "Best Monocot," add "Best Mesemb" category).  Also, Bill M submitted a list of suggestions to Judy.  Judy and Bill need to go over that list of suggestions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BY-LAWS: <I>Nothing new to report. </I>It is urged that all Board members start taking notes, outlining their responsibilities.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OLD BUSINESS: <I>Nothing new to report.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW BUSINESS:<I> The board voted on and <B>approved</B> </I>the purchase of a 12-month contract for web-space with NetMegs for $100.00, when the renewal is due. <I>The board voted on and <B>approved</B> </I>giving 10% of net sales from the show and sale to Buchser Middle School for allowing us to use their facilities for our show and sale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Buchser Middle School will be hosting a Master Gardeners day on 5/10.  Bill K will be there with CSSSJ information, demonstration plants, etc.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting was adjourned at 12:16 P.M.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next Board meeting will be on June 1st, 2003, at the Prusch Park Meeting Hall at 10:30 A.M.</P>
