<TABLE>
<tr><td>Linda shared two concerns that were brought to her from the annual holiday event:</td></tr>
<tr><td><UL>
<li>Several people were confused with the rules for the auction. Maybe we could have them in the Courier the month of the event and have someone read/review the information before the auction.</li>
<li>Some of the auction plants were not rooted and did not have this noted on the auction slip</li>
</UL></td></tr>

Roger will go to Harryâ€™s in the next week and book December 3, 2016 for the event this year. He also brought 6 new books for the club and shared/showed them at the meeting. He asked for ideas on additional books. He has completed a new listing of the books and feels that it may be risky to list them on our Web site. He feels that someone may join the club just to get the books and then disappear. Linda suggested that the club have the pricy/hard to come by books as reference only for review at the meeting only.
