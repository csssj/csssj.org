<UL>
<li><B>Finance:</B> Sonia shared the 2018 April Sale Profit &amp; Loss Statement<br><br></li>
<li><B>Spring Show and Sale (SS&amp;S) Concerns:</B><br>
There was a concern with the Show Bucks not being issued to Terri. Sonia to talk to Roger for his take on the issue. Kathi resolved the issue for the current issue. We may need to look at it again.<br><br>
There was an issue with a club member letting a non-club member in to the SS&S early, even though we have made a rule against this. This is to be addressed in future Newsletters and Sonia to follow-up on addressing this with the parties involved.<br><br>
It would be nice if there could be a print out of the vendor #s and names on the listing from Nor-Cal. It would stream line the process of paying the vendors.<br><br>
Svetlana and Roger have some nice ideas for the future Show area. They will share it with the club at a later date.<br><br>
Gary and Ellen got a check for a sold plant when they were not at the SS&S. Could this be an error or a plant that got in with someone else from the last Show and Sale. Gary suggested that when a vendor is not present and there are plants sold with their information, the plant sale go to the club.<br><br>
He also suggested that a plant without a bar code that shows up at the cash register not be allowed to be sold. The “hunting down” of information takes too long and holds up sales.<br><br>
There was a long line to the cash register. Some ideas: tables to hold plants while in line. Club members may cash out early. Additional “Cash only” register. Laminated tags with color and #s to hold plants. Separate “Go Back” table for items when the buyer changes their mind. A map of the tables with the names of the vendors. Can we open the cash registers for credit card purchases for one hour on Friday night for club members?</li>
