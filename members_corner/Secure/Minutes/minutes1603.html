Peterson's insurance has requested a copy of the school's contract with us.  Roger is handling.  Bill has lined up the following judges:  Paul Hypo, Fred Dortchort, Russel Wagner, Tom Viacze.

Kathi says Peterson will let us post a show flyer on their bulletin board.  Linda says they might have a community service requirement for their students that we could participate in.   Kathi will talk to the school about it.  Bill wants to ask the school whether any personal relationship between the school and some member of our club is needed, as was the case with Buchser.

Sonia sent a mark up a copy of the 2015 roster to Sandy.   Sandy brought an updated copy of the membership list to the board meeting.    We now have 156 members.    Sandy plans to hand out the new Roster at the April show.
