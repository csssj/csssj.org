<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LAST MONTH’S MINUTES for the Board of Directors "Advisory" Meeting on November 3, 2002 were approved.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TREASURER: The balance as of November 30, 2002, is $6,832.12.  Carla Munkacsy will be auditing the books.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MEMBERSHIP: Our new membership director, Sandy Carter, will have an accurate count of the club's current membership at the February board meeting.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HOSPITALITY: Bill Kurtz will remain the interim hospitality director.  We will try harder to find a volunteer to take over the position.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PROGRAM: The group agreed that the annual holiday party went well.  Some comments were made that the auction dragged, the opening bid on plants tended to be kind of high, and that the party could have been more festive.  We agreed that these are valid issues, but that the board has more pressing issues, such as the annual show/sale to tend to now.  These concerns should be addressed before the next holiday party.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LIBRARY: The library’s materials can best be served if they were more physically available and we are still looking for suggestions on how to display the books. We are considering auctioning some of the older non-reference books. Member at Large, Lori Habib, has taken over as our club librarian.  She is in the process of setting up a place to store the library materials, and the final transfer of materials to her is expected soon.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFFILIATE: CSSA membership renewal is coming up at the beginning of the year. <I>The board voted on and <B>approved</B></I> giving the CSSA a donation of $45 for membership, $25 for the research fund, and $25 for the color fund. Also, we will be renewing our annual membership to Guadalupe Gardens with a donation to them of $50.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MINI SHOW: The Mini-Show is now being held before the Program.  The board agreed that this is working out well.  Paul Long will be submitting a series of articles for the Courier, to explain and promote the mini-show.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANNUAL SHOW: The show and sale will be held this year on April 5<SUP>th</SUP> and 6<SUP>th</SUP>, with set up on April 4<SUP>th</SUP>.  We are now officially booked with Buchser Middle School for the event.  <I>The board voted on and <B>approved</B></I> donating roughly 10 percent of our net profit to Buchser School, as a way of showing our thanks to them for letting us use their facilities.  Bill K will be contacting the party rental company regarding table rentals.  A proof of insurance still has to be sent from the insurance company to the school. Bill K has recruited two out of the four judges needed.  Rowena suggested having an "apprentice judge" program.  We will pursue this idea.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill K passed around a paid article that the Orchid Society runs in the SJMN.  We agreed that the price charged by the SJMN is too high for such an advertisement.  Also, the city of Santa Clara's sign permitting process was deemed too expensive.  Some more acceptable means of publicity that we discussed: Bill K to approach the Santa Clara school district with a proposal that we be allowed to post flyers, banners, etc., on district property, and Bill G to work up handbills and postcards good for $1 off at the sale.  The show and sales committees will be meeting during the month to discuss other pressing issues related to the annual show/sale.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FAIR PLOT: <I>Nothing new to report.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BY-LAWS: <I>Nothing new to report. </I>It is urged that all Board members start taking notes, outlining their responsibilities.  Concerns range from too many vendors running the club; not enough new and younger members; the number of terms that can be served; and the By-Laws being hard rules versus a guideline approach.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OLD BUSINESS: Bill Gingras has volunteered to manage and develop our club’s website. He has revamped its platform. Bill has taken feedback, from all who provided, on the website’s ease and effectiveness. Any other suggestions are welcome.  It is currently up for review on his personal site (http://pages.sbcglobal.net/bgingras/).  Bill will be meeting with Rich Kroll to hash out any remaining details, such as automated dues payment by credit card, and to get it registered and published for public access.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW BUSINESS:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Rich expressed the desire to create caricatures of members, if they so desire, to be published as an occasional feature in the Courier.  While the board did not have to vote on this proposal, it gave it's collective blessing for him to do so.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Long time member Jim Daniel will be contributing to our courier on a monthly basis with his featured article spot titled &quot;What’s Bugging You&quot;. Our members appreciate his vast knowledge. </LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting was adjourned at 12:15 P.M.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next Board meeting will be on February 2, 2003, at the Prusch Park Meeting Hall at 10:30 A.M.</P>
