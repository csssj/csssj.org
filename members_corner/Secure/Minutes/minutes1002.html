AFFILIATE: Tony has stepped in and assured that our club’s Spring and Fall shows will be advertised in the CSA journals.
</P>
<P>
MINI SHOW:  Do we want to change the rules for the criteria for open / novice / advanced? Some questions as to if a person needs to move up after that level criteria has been met, or if they can stay where they are. It was discussed that they can stay at the level they are by their choice.
</P>

</P>
<br>
<P>
NEW BUSINESS: 
<UL>
<li>Kathi has been working with Rich on some new ideas for our web-site. We’re thinking of a photo archive area, and even maybe a Facebook account.<font size="-2"><br><br></font></li>
<li>There was a complaint from Prusch Park regarding the state of the meeting room after our January meeting, that it was dirty and that we didn’t take the garbage out. We may have lacked in taking the garbage out, because the last person to leave didn’t know they were supposed to take it out, but the room was untidy when we came in that day. In the future, we will assure that we will leave the room as we received it or better.<font size="-2"><br><br></font></li>
<li>Chuck is looking for assistance in mailing the postcards for the April Show and Sale.<font size="-2"><br><br></font></li>
<li>Bill K procured a bolt of black cloth to make dark-out shades for the meeting room. Kathi said she will help him cut them to size.</li>
