<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LAST MONTHâ€™S MINUTES for the Board of Directors Meeting on August 3, 2003 were approved with corrections.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TREASURER: The balance as of September 6, 2003, is $9,434.67.  One check for $350.00 is outstanding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MEMBERSHIP: The CSSSJ has 106 paid members as of 9/7/03.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HOSPITALITY: <I>Nothing new to report.  </I>Bill Kurtz will remain the interim hospitality director as we try to find a volunteer to take over the position.  The group agreed that the club needs to more aggressively find someone to take over this position.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PROGRAM: <I> </I>Program chair Bill Kurtz continues the never-ending job of procuring speakers for our meetings.  The program for the October meeting will be Mark Muridian, giving a program on desert landscaping using heavy equipment.  Mark will have his famous pots for sale at the meeting.  We will have to change the October meeting to the second Sunday of the month because Prusch Park will be having its "Fall Festival" on our regular meeting date.  For the November meeting, we will be having a mega-show-and-tell, with everyone urged to participate by bringing in a plant (their most challenging plant, favorite plant, etc.) and talking about it.  The club will have its colossal holiday extravaganza on December 7th.  For January, Larry Grammer from southern California will be demonstrating and discussing staging plants for a show.  The February and March programs are to-be-determined, and our annual Show and Sale is in April.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LIBRARY: <I>Nothing new to report. </I>We need to sort through the books in our library collection and decide which to keep and not keep.  This will be done at two future meetings.  For those meetings, the board will meet at 10:00, at which time we will decide which books we want to keep, which we want to sell at our show and sale, and which to offer at a special auction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AFFILIATE: <I>Nothing new to report.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MINI SHOW: <I>Nothing new to report.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANNUAL SHOW<I>: (new) </I>2004 Show and Sale will be April 13<SUP>th</SUP> and 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 2004.  A suggestion was made by Joel that the club devise a way for people to enter and display wall-mounted pots and hanging pots in the show.  Many suggestions were made, and we decided to pursue this for the 2004 Show and Sale.  We will let it be known that we will have these display means available, and ask exhibitors to let us know how many wall-mounted or hanging plants they plan to enter.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(action items for next year)</I> New vendor participation policy (see 6/1/03 minutes).  Ensure that four additional tables are available for a plant-hold area.  Look into an "apprentice judge" program.  Compile a mailing list, once all lists, tags, etc., have been located.  Investigate and update (as pertinent) the "show rules" list per suggestions (alphabetical cross-reference, change "Best Liliaceae" category to "Best Monocot," add "Best Mesemb" category).  Also, Bill M submitted a list of suggestions to Judy.  Judy and Bill need to go over that list of suggestions.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OLD BUSINESS: <I>None.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEW BUSINESS: President Wes Briggs officially appointed Joel Parker as the new CSSSJ Vice-President.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill K suggested that we re-think transportation fees for speakers.  The suggestion was made that we separate transportation fees from speaker fees.  The board agreed to work out a fair compensation scheme for transportation-related expenses.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bill K also suggested that we make an effort to purchase Christmas Banquet gift plants from local vendors who are members of the club.  We usually give away 70-80 plants at the banquet. <I>The board voted on and <B>approved</B> </I>using four local vendors for gift plants.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting was adjourned at 12:04 P.M.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next Board meeting will be on October 12th, 2003, at the Prusch Park Meeting Hall at 10:30 A.M., unless decided otherwise.</P>
