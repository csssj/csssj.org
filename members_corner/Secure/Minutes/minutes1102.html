MINI SHOW:  Kathi is requesting reimbursement for protective storage for mini show supplies. $10-$15, Board made a motion and approved for her to get supplies. A poll needs to be taken in June to seek approval or disapproval of the limit 3 plants per person for the mini show. It was discussed that the timeframe of the meeting should be posted on the site, so that people are not bringing plants for the mini show late which creates chaos.
</P>

SPRING SHOW: Awards updated. Categories added and subtracted per Jaan. New rule for photography to be matted and not framed.  More updates to be posted on site. We need to contact Rich to publish link to show rules, a URL on the newsletter. Bill needs to contact judges. In March’s meeting we need to have a call for clerks and security volunteers for Aprils show. Est. $300-$400 to be spent on awards.  From this point forward judges should get a copy of our rules and abide by them in judging. Roger to order the same amount of tables  and sizes as done for Fall’s show. Potting demo TBD based on weather, Potters to help with potting demo? Email only addresses need attention. Peter B. to email notices to email only people. We also need to figure out Buchser School donation.
