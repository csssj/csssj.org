<B><I>LAST MONTH’S MINUTES</I></B> for the Board of Directors Meeting on September 12, 2010, <B><I>were approved.</I></B>
</P>
<P>
<B>TREASURER:</B> The balance as of November 1, 2010, is approx. $27,490. This increase in our balance was partly due to the profits we took in of approximately $4,900 from our Fall Show and Sale held in October. We discussed making a charitable contribution to a school, or UC Santa Cruz, or perhaps the Ruth Bancroft Garden Foundation. We certainly can expand some of our club’s extra-curricular activities such as local garden or related gardening tours.
</P>
<P>
<B>MEMBERSHIP:</B>  4 new members from the Fall Show and Sale. 1 new member from an Internet search. Total 161 members.
</P>
<P>
<B>HOSPITALITY:</B> Thanks to Anthony and Vicki Ortiz for helping out with this function!
</P>
<P>
The January <B>PROGRAM</B> will be a hands-on Pottery Workshop given by club member Kim Manfredi.
</P>
<P>
<B>LIBRARY:</B>  There has been a steady stream of interest from our new members. Linda indicates that most of the books she brings get checked out.
</P>
<P>
<B>AFFILIATE:</B> The 46<sup>th</sup> annual CSSA show will be in San Diego on April 24-29, 2011. We may look into having a group trip there if enough interest.
</P>
<P>
<B>MINI SHOW:</B> To help allow all the participants of the mini-show enough time to talk about their plants, <B><I>a motion was proposed and approved</I></B> to limit the number of entries per person to a grand total of (3) plants total combined of all the categories they choose to enter.
</P>
<P>
<B>SPRING SHOW:</B>  As we have put in place new positions overseeing the show and sale events, we are now looking for someone to organize and run the security aspects. For Spring of 2011, we will hold our event at Buchser School. The school facilities will not be available for the Fall 2011 Show and Sale, nor will it be available for all of 2012 due to upgrades being performed at the school. We will be looking for a new venue.
</P>
<P>
<B>FALL SHOW:</B> The Show and Sale was hugely successful. We made over $4,900 in profit after expenses. It was felt that we should use barcodes next time for the smaller vendors, also, instead of the double-stickers. Not having the barcodes really slowed things up at the cash register.

</P>
<P>
<B>BY-LAWS:</B>We need to determine where within our website the By-Laws should reside:

</TABLE>
</P>
<P>
<B>OLD BUSINESS:</B> Rich has upgraded our web-site and we are in the process of adding new features. We are looking at possibly 4-new picture categories, which we will ask people to vote on their preference: cactus & succulents, in the ground, show & sale, something special.
<font size="-2"><br></font>
<UL>
<li>Look for increased storage space on the csssj.org web-site by December. We are still working out the criteria for who can post, the number of pictures that can get posted, their format, size, and duration on the site. Please contact Rich Kroll with your suggestions at <a href="mailto:csssj@ckart.com">csssj@ckart.com</a></li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
