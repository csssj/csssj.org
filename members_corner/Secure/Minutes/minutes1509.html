Sonia has taken over working with Rich Kroll on getting the newsletter out.  It took her 4.2 hours of her time to get 58 hardcopy newsletters ready to mail.  Most of the people on the hardcopy distribution list are believed to have email.  Sonia proposed that we put an announcement in the next newsletter that the hardcopy version is going away at the end of the year, except for those without internet access.   MSP.

Sonia will give Bill another copy of the 5-yr-old procedure on setting up the venue for the show and sale, for him to mark up with respect to our dealings with Peterson.

Roger will let Loyd know that Steve McCabe is willing to be a speaker.

Bancroft Gardens is collecting challenge-grant donations for a new visitor's center.   Kathi said their first challenge-grant was filled and they've started another one.  Last month we MSP that we donate $1000.   Roger still to follow up.

<P>
Terri discussed the food arrangements for the show and sale.  Bill will get pizza on Friday night.   Terri will supply BBQ on Saturday and Togo's on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kathi had previously suggested we consider getting a storage locker for the show's rolls of paper, boxes of forms and ribbons, etc.    Right now the stuff is scattered amongst the garages of various members.  Loyd will put together an inventory of what show stuff we've got and who currently has it.
