</P>
<P>
OLD BUSINESS:
<UL>
<li>There was a complaint from Prusch Park regarding the state of the meeting room after our January meeting, that it was dirty and that we didn’t take the garbage out. We may have lacked in taking the garbage out, because the last person to leave didn’t know they were supposed to take it out, but the room was untidy when we came in that day. In the future, we will assure that we will leave the room as we received it or better.<font size="-2"><br><br></font></li>

<li>Sandy to come up with a monthly notice for our courier announcing new members.<font size="-2"><br><br></font></li>

<li>Kathi has been working with Rich on some new ideas for our web-site. We’re thinking of a photo archive area, and even maybe a Facebook account.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<br>
<P>
NEW BUSINESS:
<UL>
<li>Bill K procured a bolt of black cloth to make dark-out shades for the meeting room. Kathi said she would help him cut them to size.</li>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
The meeting was adjourned at 11:40 A.M.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting will be on May 2, 2010, at the Prusch Park Meeting Hall at 10:30 A.M.
