      <h2 id="visitor-tips">
        Visitor Tips
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Saturday mornings tend to be <i>extremely</i> busy! If If you
          don’t like crowds, you might want to wait until after 2 PM, or
          Sunday.
        </li>

        <li>
          The doors will not open early.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring your own boxes — while we will have some on-site, bringing
          your own will spare you from having to hunt for the one that's
          “just right”.
        </li>

        <li>
          You may want to take advantage of our Plant Hotel (see its
          <a href="Plant Hotel Info.pdf">information page</a>)
          to hold your plants while you continue shopping. Be sure to
          hang on to the numbered tags you're given, so you can
          retrieve your plants.

        <li>
          Pets, in particular dogs, are not allowed. (Sorry. It’s not
          that we don’t love them. It’s just that it’s safer for
          everyone if they stay home, and in any case, school rules
          forbid themt.)
        </li>

        <li>
          To make shopping safer and more pleasant, the aisles will be
          wider than in pre-pandemic days.
        </li>

        <li>
          The wider aisles notwithstanding, while you’re welcome to
          bring your cart to help transport all of your purchases,
          please keep said cart out of the aisles themselves.
        </li>

        <li>
          For faster checkout, please plan to pay by debit or credit
          card. Our systems support contactless payment, including Apple
          Pay and Google Pay. Unfortunately, we are unable to take
          checks. Cash is acceptable.
        </li>

        <li>
          You can sign up for CSSSJ membership at the Show and Sale,
