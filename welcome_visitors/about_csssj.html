<h2><a name="about">About the CSSSJ</h2>

The Cactus & Succulent Society of San Jose, an affiliate of the Cactus & Succulent Society of America, was founded in 1960 for the purposes of fostering education, propagation and conservation of succulent plants.  Our membership has grown over the years, but we remain a dynamic group of hobbyists with an interest in sharing knowledge and tips with fellow hobbyists; whether novice or advanced - or even brand new!
<p>
Please consider joining us.  Members enjoy the following benefits:

<ul>
<li><b>The Cactus Courier</b> - Members receive our monthly newsletter which contains information on upcoming club activities as well as articles on plant culture, habitat issues, and other topics of interest.  

<li><b>Extensive Library</b> - The club maintains a large collection of reference books and journals that are of interest to cactus and succulent hobbyists.  Many of our books and journals are specialty items that you will not find in your local library. 

<li><b>Annual Show &amp; Sale</b> - Our annual Show &amp; Sale takes place typically in the Spring, and provides our membership with a forum for showing off their prized specimens.  Vendors sell many rare and not-so-rare plants and other related wares at reasonable prices.  If you have any interest at all in cacti or other succulents, this event is especially impressive and not to be missed.

<li><b>Field Trips</b> - We occasionally tour local botanical gardens, member collections, and cacti &amp; succulent nurseries.

<li><b>Holiday Banquet</b> - Our holiday extravaganza, held in early December, features good fun, food, drink, company, plant give-a-ways, and a colossal plant mega-auction.

<li><b>Monthly Meetings</b> - So much goes on at our monthly meetings. Read on...
</ul>

<h2><a name="benefits"> Monthly Meetings</h2>

Check out the <a href="../index.html">CSSSJ Homepage</a> for the latest meeting information.  In general, our meetings feature the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Program</b> - We feature a different guest speaker or hands-on workshop every month, highlighting different aspects of the hobby.  Speaker-oriented presentations include travel-logs and slide shows highlighting specific plant types.  Workshops might center around potting, maintenance, and other general care issues.

<li><b>Door Prizes</b> - Guests as well as members participate in at least one door prize drawing per meeting.  In addition, members wearing their name badges are eligible to participate in a special name badge drawing.  Door prizes are typically nice potted cacti or other interesting succulent plants.

<li><b>Socializing</b> - Visit with folks who share your interest in the great hobby of cacti &amp; succulents.  Make new friends.  Our membership contains people of all levels from rank beginners to nursery professionals. 

<li><b>Refreshments</b> - Goodies are provided by a different group of members each month.  The club provides soft drinks, cups, plates, and utensils.  A few times a year, we start the meeting early and host a pot-luck dinner.

<li><b>Vendor of the Month</b> - With prior consent of the vendor-of-the-month chairperson, presenters and club members can sell plants at the meeting.  The selection is often fantastic and certainly not what you can find at your typical nursery.

<li><b>Show &amp; Tell</b> - Have a cactus that is just bursting out in bloom?  Have a plant that was given to you by your great Aunt, and you'd love to know what the heck it is?  Have a plant that just isn't doing so great, no matter how hard you try? Show &amp; Tell provides a forum for showing off your prized posession, or for getting answers to those tough questions.

<li><b>Mini-Show</b> - Each month, one cactus and one other succulent is featured in this mini-competition, which is judged by those present at the meeting. Members may enter a total of five plants altogether, but are welcome to bring in additional plants to discuss or share. Votes are worth points, and they can add up for year-end prizes. This is a great educational activity and a lot of fun.
</ul>
