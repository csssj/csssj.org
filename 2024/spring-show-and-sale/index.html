        Visitor Tips
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Saturday mornings tend to be <i>extremely</i> busy! If If you
          don’t like crowds, you might want to wait until after 2 PM, or
          Sunday.
        </li>

        <li>
          The doors will not open early.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring your own boxes — while we will have some on-site, bringing
          your own will spare you from having to hunt for the one that's
          "just right".
        </li>

        <li>
          You may want to take advantage of our Plant Hotel (see its
          <a href="Plant Hotel Info.pdf">information page</a>)
          to hold your plants while you continue shopping. Be sure to
          hang on to the numbered tags you're given, so you can
          retrieve your plants.

        <li>
          Pets, in particular dogs, are not allowed. (Sorry. It’s not
          that we don’t love them. It’s just that it’s safer for
          everyone if they stay home, and in any case, fairgrounds rules
          forbid it.)
        </li>

        <li>
          To make shopping safer and more pleasant, the aisles will be
          wider than in pre-pandemic days.
        </li>

        <li>
          The wider aisles notwithstanding, while you’re welcome to
          bring your cart to help transport all of your purchases,
          please keep said cart out of the aisles themselves.
        </li>

        <li>
          For faster checkout, please plan to pay by debit or credit
          card. Our systems support contactless payment, including Apple
          Pay and Google Pay. Unfortunately, we are unable to take
          checks. Cash is acceptable.
        </li>

        <li>
          You can sign up for CSSSJ membership at the Show and Sale, as
          well
          as <a href="https://csssj-membership.square.site/shop/membership/2">online</a>.
          Please note, however, that we will <b>not</b> be taking
          membership signups at the door during early access.

        How Can I Help?
      </h2>

        Thanks for asking! There are several things you can do
        before and during the event.

          dibs on shopping early Friday afternoon. (You could earn up

        What Are The Rules For Entering The “People’s Choice” Show?
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You must be a current member of CSSSJ.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must have owned the plants you exhibit for at least six months.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because it is a People’s Choice show, rather than a judged
          show, you may choose to be a bit more relaxed in selecting
          your entries. However, we encourage you to enter your best
          as you want to garner the most votes from the public.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each member is allowed a <i>maximum</i> of 10 plants to
          show, as we have a limited amount of space for them.
          Please provide a list of what you are entering, with your
          name on it, to assist with our recordkeeping.
        </li>
        <li>
          Entries need to arrive by 4:30 PM Friday for the show. You
          will find entry tags for each classification (see below
          for details). Write up your tags, putting the information
          on both halves. Fold in half, leaving your name on both
          halves for the counting of points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Exhibitor Classifications:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Novice</b>: You are under 18, have not won a total
            of 50 first-place ribbons in previous CSSA affiliated
            shows, or have been competing for less than 5 years.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Advanced</b>: If you no longer qualify as a novice,
            you must exhibit in this class.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Open</b>: If you possess or have possessed a
            nurseryman’s license, or earn a substantial income from
            the sale of plants, you must exhibit in this class.
          </li>
