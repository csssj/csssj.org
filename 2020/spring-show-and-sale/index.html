        <p>
          For sale, meanwhile, will be a wide variety of cacti and
          succulents, along with pots and assorted accessories, with the
          vendors who raised the plants from seeds and pups there
          to answer your questions and provide suggestions.
        </p>

        <h2>What Else Do I Need To Know?</h2>

        <p>A few things to make your visit as much fun as possible:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            No early birds, please. The doors open at 9:00 on
            Saturday, and not before.
          </li>

          <li>
            Saturday morning tends to be <i>extremely</i> busy! If
            you’d like a quieter time to visit, we’d recommend
            Saturday after 2 pm, or Sunday.
          </li>

          <li>
            Pets, in particular dogs, are not allowed. (Sorry. It’s
            not that we don’t love them. It’s just that it’s safer for
            everyone if they stay home, and in any case, school rules forbid
            it.)
          </li>

          <li>
            You may want to take advantage of our Plant Hotel to
            hold your plants while you continue shopping. Be sure to
            hang on to your claim check, so you can retrieve your
            plants. (Please note that plants must be must be picked up
            90 minutes before the end of each day’s sale. Also, those
            who’ve attended previous Show and Sale events should note
            that the Plant Hotel has moved, and is now outside the
            building, in the courtyard.) For more details on the Plant
            Hotel, see the <a
            href="/public-docs/PlantHotelFAQ.html">Plant Hotel
            FAQ</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            While you’re welcome to bring your cart to help transport
            all of your purchases, please keep it out of the aisles
            between the tables themselves: the aisles are relatively
            narrow, and we’d prefer that no one bang their shins.
            You’re invited to park your transport in the Cart Corral,
            adjacent to the Plant Hotel until you’re ready to check
            out.
          </li>

          <li>
            You can sign up for our mailing list in either the show or
            sale areas.
          </li>

          <li>
            Ask questions! Many of our members are highly-regarded
            experts, and are more than happy to talk about cactus and
            succulent plants.
          </li>

          <li>
            You may pay for your purchase using cash, a check, or a
            credit card. Our systems support Apple Pay and Google Pay.
            If you make your purchase with a credit card, please note
            that the sale will show up on your statement as “Northern
            California-Los Altos”.
          </li>

        <h2>How Can I Help?</h2>

        <p>
          Thanks for asking! There are several things you can do
          before and during the event.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Tell your friends.</b> Point them at our website and this
            page, as well as at the club’s <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/SJcactussucculents/">Facebook</a>
            and <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/sj_cactus_succulent/">Instagram</a>
            pages.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Print out and distribute our official flyer at your
            school/club/workplace.</b> You can get the full-page,
            full-color version <a href="flyer.pdf">here</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Bring your own boxes or reusable containers.</b> While
            we amass a large set of boxes for your use before each
            sale, their numbers tend to dwindle as the day progresses.
            Scrap paper — old newspaper, or packing paper — is also
            immesely useful for padding purchases securely.
          </li>
